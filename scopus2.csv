WRF-Chem simulations on 2017 showed that based on the six-city average, the aerosol load (PM2.5 concentrations) of 121.9, 49.6, 43.3, and 66.3 µg/m3 in January, April, July, and October, mainly lowered the level of downward shortwave radiation by 38.9, 24.0, 59.1, and 24.4 W/m2 and reduced the boundary layer height by 79.9, 40.8, 87.4, and 31.0 m, via scattering and absorbing solar radiation. The sensitivity of meteorological changes to identical aerosol loads varied in the order July &gt; January &gt; October and April. Then, the cooling and stabilizing effects of aerosols further led to increases in PM2.5, by 23.0, 3.4, 4.6, and 7.3 µg/m3 respectively in the four months. The sensitivity of the effect of aerosols on PM2.5 was greatest in January rather than in July, contrary to the effect on meteorology. Moreover, a negative linear relation was observed between daily BLH reductions and aerosol loads in fall and winter, and between PM2.5 increases and aerosol loads in all seasons. With the PM2.5 pollution improvements in this region, the aerosol radiative forcing was effectively reduced. This should result in daily BLH increases of 10–24 m in fall and winter, and the estimates in Beijing agreed well with the corresponding results based on AMDAR data. Additionally, the reduction in aerosol radiation effects brought about daily PM2.5 decreases of 1.6-2.8 µg/m3, accounting for 7.0%–17.7% in PM2.5 improvements. © 2022",Aerosol; Boundary layer height (BLH); North China; PM2.5; Radiative forcing,Atmospheric radiation; Boundary layer flow; Boundary layers; Radiation effects; Aerosol-radiation interactions; Boundary layer height; Boundary layer heights; Cooling effects; North China; PM 2.5; Radiative forcings; Short-wave radiation; Stabilizing effects; WRF/Chem; Aerosols; aerosol; aerosol composition; boundary layer; computer simulation; concentration (composition); numerical model; radiative forcing; shortwave radiation; solar radiation; China,study conducted aerosol radiation interaction six city region within 2015 2019 period wrf chem simulation 2017 showed based six city average aerosol load pm2 5 concentration 121 9 49 6 43 3 66 3 µg m3 january april july october mainly lowered level downward shortwave radiation 38 9 24 0 59 1 24 4 w m2 reduced boundary layer height 79 9 40 8 87 4 31 0 via scattering absorbing solar radiation sensitivity meteorological change identical aerosol load varied order july gt january gt october april cooling stabilizing effect aerosol led increase pm2 5 23 0 3 4 4 6 7 3 µg m3 respectively four month sensitivity effect aerosol pm2 5 greatest january rather july contrary effect meteorology moreover negative linear relation observed daily blh reduction aerosol load fall winter pm2 5 increase aerosol load season pm2 5 pollution improvement region aerosol radiative forcing effectively reduced result daily blh increase 10 24 fall winter estimate beijing agreed well corresponding result based amdar data additionally reduction aerosol radiation effect brought daily pm2 5 decrease 1 6 2 8 µg m3 accounting 7 0 17 7 pm2 5 improvement 2022,load fall winter; wrf chem simulation; boundary layer height; period wrf chem; aerosol load season; daily blh reduction; fall winter estimate; load varied order; study conducted aerosol; observed daily blh; winter estimate beijing; data additionally reduction; reduction aerosol load; aerosol load fall; relation observed daily; lowered level downward; level downward shortwave; scattering absorbing solar; meteorological change identical; negative linear relation,ctober april cooling; april july october; chem simulation 2017; order july gt; accounting 17 pm2,Study ;Aerosol ;Radiation ;Interaction ;Six City ;Region ;20152019 ;WRFChem ;Simulation ;2017 ;PM2.5 ;Concent,0.2231244623267587,0.0506986255685893,0.1258729684284116

However, exact results in this context are available in only very few cases. In this work, we present the proof of the quasiparticle picture for the dynamics of entanglement entropies for two disjoint blocks in the XY chain after a quantum quench. As a byproduct, we also prove the quasiparticle conjecture for the mutual information in that model. Our calculations generalize those presented in Fagotti and Calabrese (2008 Phys. Rev. A 78 010306) to the case where the correlation matrix is a block-Toeplitz matrix, and rely on the multidimensional stationary phase approximation in the scaling limit. We also test the quasiparticle predictions against exact numerical calculations, and find excellent agreement. In the case of three blocks, we show that the tripartite information vanishes when at least two blocks are adjacent. © 2023 The Author(s).

METHODS: An electronic search was conducted in databases including PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, the Cochrane Library, and CNKI from their inception to January 2022. We calculated the odds ratio (OR) and mean difference (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) to assess the effect of DAA compared to PLA for the management of total hip arthroplasty (THA) in elderly patients using the dichotomous or continuous method with a random or fixed-effect model. RESULTS: 15 studies involving 1284 patients were included; 640 patients receiving DAA and 644 patients receiving PLA. DAA had a longer surgery duration than PLA [WMD = 9.41, 95% CI (4.64, 14.19), I2=95.5%]; The amount of postoperative drainage [WMD= -3.88, 95% CI (-5.59, -2.17), I2=98.3%], length of incision [WMD= -3.88, 95% CI (-5.59, -2.17), I2=98.3%], blood loss [WMD= -3.88, 95% CI (-5.59, -2.17), I2=98.3%], hospitalization time [WMD= -3.88, 95% CI (-5.59, -2.17), I2=98.3%], and postoperative bedtime [WMD = -5.56,95% CI (-7.11, -4.01), I2=99.0%], were similar between the two groups (p < 0.05). The HHS at 1 month, 12 months postoperatively [WMD = 7.58, 95%CI (5.70,9.46), I2=89.5%; WMD= 2.56, 95%CI 0.11,5.00, I2=93.2%] and the incidence of LFCN in patients were higher in the DAA group (OR = 2.91, 95% CI 1.26 to 6.71, I2=0.0%), while fewer patients in the DAA group suffered from postoperative dislocation than in the PLA group (OR = 0.26, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.60, I2=0.0%). No significant difference was observed in HHS at 1 week, 3 months, and 6 months postoperatively, VAS postoperatively at each time point, acetabular anteversion angle, acetabular abduction angle, wound infection, deep vein thrombosis, and intraoperative fracture (p > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: DAA offers a quicker functional recovery and is less invasive with an earlier return to daily activities in older THA patients than PLA. However, DAA was found to be associated with a high incidence of lateral femoral cutaneous nerve injury and a low incidence of postoperative dislocation.Key messagesThe present study aims to evaluate the clinical outcomes in elderly patients receiving DAA versus PLA for THA in the treatment of femoral neck fractures by mate-analysis.DAA offers a quicker functional recovery and is less invasive with an earlier return to daily activities in older THA patients.

When chronological age is not available, age estimation is required, particularly in court cases. The mineralization chronology of permanent teeth is a valuable tool for age estimation of subadults. This study aimed to evaluate the mineralization stages of permanent teeth of Brazilian subjects from imaging exams, using the classification by Moorrees et al. modified by the authors, to verify the existence of correlation between the chronology of mineralization stages and sex and to prepare numerical tables of the chronology of dental mineralization stages for Brazilian individuals. Methods: Digital panoramic radiographs of 1100 living Brazilian individuals of both sexes, aged between 2 and 25 years, born between 1990 and 2018, from the image bank of a Dental Radiographs and Documentations clinic located in the city of Araraquara, SP, Brazil. The images were evaluated according to the level of crown and root development and classified according to the stages proposed by Moorrees et al. (Am J Phys Anthropol 21: 205–213, 1963) adapted by the authors. All analyses were performed in the R software. Descriptive and exploratory analyses were performed on all data. For intra- and inter-examiner analyses, the rate of agreement and Kappa statistics at a 95% confidence interval were used. Kappa was interpreted according to Landis and Koch. Results: Only upper and lower canines showed significant differences between the sexes (p < 0.05), with higher average ages for men. The findings were presented in tables, as well as age estimates with 95% confidence intervals for each mineralization stage and each tooth. Conclusion: In the present study, we evaluated the mineralization stages of permanent teeth of Brazilian subjects from digital panoramic radiographs and found no correlation between the chronology of mineralization stages and sex, except for canines.

The radiation-based sterile insect technique (SIT) has a limited effect on mosquito control because of the difficulty in irradiating males without reducing their mating competitiveness. In this study, the insect sex pheromone heptacosane was applied to Ae. aegypti males to investigate whether it could enhance the mating competitiveness of irradiated males. Methods: Heptacosane was smeared on the abdomens of Ae. aegypti males that were allowed to mate with untreated virgin females. The insemination rate was used to assess the attractiveness of heptacosane-treated males to females. The pupae were irradiated with different doses of X-rays and γ-rays, and the emergence, survival time, egg number, and hatch rate were detected to find the optimal dose of X-ray and γ-ray radiation. The males irradiated at the optimal dose were smeared with heptacosane, released in different ratios with untreated males, and mated with females. The effect of heptacosane on the mating competitiveness of irradiated mosquitoes was then evaluated by the hatch rate, induced sterility, and mating competitiveness index. Results: Applying heptacosane to Ae. aegypti males significantly increased the insemination rate of females by 20%. Pupal radiation did not affect egg number but significantly reduced survival time and hatch rate. The emergence of the pupae was not affected by X-ray radiation but was affected by γ-ray radiation. Pupae exposed to 60 Gy X-rays and 40 Gy γ-rays were selected for subsequent experiments. After 60 Gy X-ray irradiation or 40 Gy γ-ray irradiation, the average hatch rate was less than 0.1%, and the average survival time was more than 15 days. Moreover, at the same release ratio, the hatch rate of the irradiated group perfumed with heptacosane was lower than that of the group without heptacosane. Conversely, the male sterility and male mating competitiveness index were significantly increased due to the use of heptacosane. Conclusions: The sex pheromone heptacosane enhanced the interaction between Ae. aegypti males and females. Perfuming males irradiated by X-rays or γ-rays with heptacosane led to a significant increase in mating competitiveness. This study provided a new idea for improving the application effect of SIT.

The PISA assessment framework provides the backbone to the interpretation of the results of the PISA test scores. However, an identified gap in the current literature is whether mode effects have affected test score interpretation as defined by the assessment framework, and whether the interpretations of the PBA and CBA test scores are comparable. Methods: This study uses the 2015 PISA field trial data from thirteen countries to compare test modes through a construct representation approach. It is investigated whether item facets defined by the assessment framework (e.g., different cognitive demands) affect item difficulty comparably across modes using a unidimensional two-group generalized partial credit model (GPCM). Results: Linking the assessment framework to item difficulty using linear regression showed that for both maths and science domains, item categorisation relates to item difficulty, however for the reading domain no such conclusion was possible. In comparing PBA to CBA in representations across the three domains, maths had one facet with a significant difference in representation, reading had all three facets significantly different, and for science, four out of six facets had significant differences. Modelling items labelled “mode invariant” in PISA 2015, the results indicated that in every domain, two facets showed significant differences between the test modes. The graphical inspection of difficulty patterns confirmed that reading shows stronger differences while the patterns of the other domains were quite consistent between modes. Conclusions: The present study shows that the mode effects on difficulty vary within the task facets proposed by the PISA assessment framework, in particular for reading. These findings shed light on whether the comparability of score interpretation between modes is compromised. Given the limitations of the link between the reading domain and item difficulty, any conclusions in this domain are limited. Importantly, the present study adds a new approach and empirical findings to the investigation of the cross-mode equivalence in PISA domains. © 2023, The Author(s).",Assessment framework; Construct representation; Generalized partial credit model; Item facets; Mode effects; PISA,,background mode effect variation item scale property attributed mode test administration paper v computer stimulated research around test equivalence trend estimation pisa pisa assessment framework provides backbone interpretation result pisa test score however identified gap current literature whether mode effect affected test score interpretation defined assessment framework whether interpretation pba cba test score comparable method study us 2015 pisa field trial data thirteen country compare test mode construct representation approach investigated whether item facet defined assessment framework e g different cognitive demand affect item difficulty comparably across mode using unidimensional two group generalized partial credit model gpcm result linking assessment framework item difficulty using linear regression showed math science domain item categorisation relates item difficulty however reading domain conclusion possible comparing pba cba representation across three domain math one facet significant difference representation reading three facet significantly different science four six facet significant difference modelling item labelled mode invariant pisa 2015 result indicated every domain two facet showed significant difference test mode graphical inspection difficulty pattern confirmed reading show stronger difference pattern domain quite consistent mode conclusion present study show mode effect difficulty vary within task facet proposed pisa assessment framework particular reading finding shed light whether comparability score interpretation mode compromised given limitation link reading domain item difficulty conclusion domain limited importantly present study add new approach empirical finding investigation cross mode equivalence pisa domain 2023 author,defined assessment framework; pisa assessment framework; facet significant difference; linking assessment framework; interpretation defined assessment; assessment framework item; significant difference modelling; result linking assessment; comparing pba cba; score comparable method; showed significant difference; facet defined assessment; limited importantly present; scale property attributed; computer stimulated research; identified gap current; gap current literature; field trial data; trial data thirteen; data thirteen country,research test equivalence; study 2015 pisa; representation domain math; method study 2015; domain math facet,background; mode; effect; variation; item; scale; property; attributed; test; administration; paper; computer; stimulated; research; around; equivalence; trend; estimation; PISA; assessment; framework; provides; backbone; interpretation; result; score; gap,0.2912313101364071,0.124507165955531,0.2630466308869612

Using data from the NEPS Newborn Cohort study, this paper focuses on 4 year-old children and the effects of the numerical and literacy stimulation during mother–child interactions they received at age 2. After controlling for different domain-specific stimulations, structural characteristics of the children’s home learning environment, parental views, important child characteristics, and general educational processes between mother and child, empirical analyses showed small but statistically significant gender differences in mathematical competencies favoring girls. Early domain-specific stimulation in mother–child interactions at age 2 did not offer a good explanation for this math advantage of girls over boys at age 4. Nonetheless, even when 2 year-old girls received numerical stimulation quite similar to that of boys, there was some evidence that girls received a higher input in terms of literacy stimulation, and this is related to the small advantage of girls in mathematical competencies at age 4. © 2023, The Author(s).",Domain-specific stimulation; Early mother–child interactions; Gender; Mathematical competencies,,gender difference mathematical competency favoring boy well researched school late kindergarten age much le known earlier development using data neps newborn cohort study paper focus 4 year old child effect numerical literacy stimulation mother child interaction received age 2 controlling different domain specific stimulation structural characteristic child home learning environment parental view important child characteristic general educational process mother child empirical analysis showed small statistically significant gender difference mathematical competency favoring girl early domain specific stimulation mother child interaction age 2 offer good explanation math advantage girl boy age 4 nonetheless even 2 year old girl received numerical stimulation quite similar boy evidence girl received higher input term literacy stimulation related small advantage girl mathematical competency age 4 2023 author,difference mathematical competency; gender difference mathematical; mathematical competency favoring; domain specific stimulation; mother child interaction; stimulation mother child; study paper focus; offer good explanation; significant gender difference; early domain specific; specific stimulation mother; educational process mother; girl mathematical competency; specific stimulation structural; statistically significant gender; explanation math advantage; input term literacy; researched school late; school late kindergarten; data neps newborn,girl mathematical competency; math advantage girl; advantage girl mathematical; boy evidence girl; neps newborn cohort,Gender Difference;Mathematical Competency;Favoring Boy/Girl;Well Researched;School Late/Kindergarten Age;Much Less Known Earlier Development;Using Data;NEPS Newborn Cohort Study;Paper Focus; ,0.6107027777449487,0.0671611794237715,0.09506179886307622

A concept extensively studied in education is engagement, a multidimensional construct encompassing behavioral expression and motivational backgrounds. This metric can be used to not only guide certain pedagogic methodologies, but also to endow systems with the right tutoring techniques. As such, this article aims to inspire improved teaching styles and automatic learning systems, by experimentally verifying the influence of in-class behaviors in students’ engagement. Results: Over 16 math lessons, the occurrence of students’ and instructors’ behaviors, alongside students’ engagement estimates, were recorded using the COPUS observation protocol. After behavior-profiling the classes deploying such lessons, significant linear models were computed to relate the frequency of the students’ or instructors’ behaviors with the students’ engagement at different in-class periods. The models revealed a positive relation of students’ initial individual thinking and later group activity participation with their collective engagement, as well as a positive engagement relation with the later application of instructor’s strategies such as giving feedback and moving through class, guiding on-going work. Conclusions: The results suggest the benefit of applying a workshop-like learning process, providing more individual explanations and feedback at the beginning of an interaction, leaving collective feedback and students’ guidance of on-going work for later on. Based on the relations suggested by our models, several guidelines for developing ALSs are proposed, and a practical illustrative example is formulated. © 2023, The Author(s).",Adaptive Learning Systems; Behavioral engagement; COPUS Protocol; STEM Education,,background growing necessity providing better education notably development adaptive learning system als leveraged study several psychological construct accurately characterize learner concept extensively studied education engagement multidimensional construct encompassing behavioral expression motivational background metric used guide certain pedagogic methodology also endow system right tutoring technique article aim inspire improved teaching style automatic learning system experimentally verifying influence class behavior student engagement result 16 math lesson occurrence student instructor behavior alongside student engagement estimate recorded using copus observation protocol behavior profiling class deploying lesson significant linear model computed relate frequency student instructor behavior student engagement different class period model revealed positive relation student initial individual thinking later group activity participation collective engagement well positive engagement relation later application instructor strategy giving feedback moving class guiding going work conclusion result suggest benefit applying workshop like learning process providing individual explanation feedback beginning interaction leaving collective feedback student guidance going work later based relation suggested model several guideline developing als proposed practical illustrative example formulated 2023 author,student instructor behavior; math lesson occurrence; application instructor strategy; instructor strategy giving; behavior student engagement; notably development adaptive; accurately characterize learner; characterize learner concept; learner concept extensively; concept extensively studied; encompassing behavioral expression; behavioral expression motivational; tutoring technique article; technique article aim; article aim inspire; aim inspire improved; inspire improved teaching; improved teaching style; teaching style automatic; experimentally verifying influence,inspire improved teaching; improved teaching style; class deploying lesson; improved teaching; profiling class deploying,education; adaptive learning system; psychological construct; engagement; behavior; motivational; metric; pedagogic; tutoring; teaching style; automatic learning system; math lesson; student instructor; observation protocol; behavior profiling; linear model; collective engagement; instructor strategy; feedback; workshop,0.1135376365975465,0.0,0.30053406766036234

P-15 peptides could bind to integrin receptors on various precursor cells, promote cell adhesion, release growth factors, and promote the differentiation of osteoblast precursor cells. However, the role of P-15 in OA, particularly in chondrocyte proliferation, is not fully understood. Methods: The activity of SFPQ and RUNX2 in the bone tissue of patients with osteoarthritis was analyzed using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Interleukin-1β (IL-1β) inducer was performed to establish an in vitro model of OA. Cell proliferation was measured by CCK-8 assay. The expressions of COL2a1, ACAN, COMP, SOX9, and BMP2 related to cartilage differentiation were detected using qRT-PCR. In addition, the expression levels of SFPQ, AKT, p-AKT, and RUNX2 were detected using Western blotting. Results: The results showed that the expression of SFPQ was significantly decreased and the expression of RUNX2 was significantly increased in osteoarthritis cartilage tissue. P-15 peptide reversed IL-1β-induced cell proliferation obstruction and alleviated chondrocyte damage. Furthermore, P-15 polypeptide increased the expression levels of cartilage differentiation genes COL2a1, ACAN, and BMP2, while decreasing the expression of COMP and SOX9 in an inverse dose-dependent manner. Then specific interfering RNA proved that P-15 maintains chondrocyte stability and is associated with the SFPQ gene. Finally, we confirmed that P-15 inhibited the Akt-RUNX2 pathway, which is regulated in the expression of SFPQ. Conclusions: P-15 can mitigate chondrocyte damage and osteoarthritis progression by inhibiting cell death and modulating SFPQ-Akt-RUNX2 pathway, offering an opportunity to develop new strategies for the treatment of osteoarthritis. © 2023, The Author(s).",Akt-RUNX2 axis; Chondrocytes; P-15 peptide; Proliferation; SFPQ,"interleukin 1beta; protein kinase B; RUNX2 protein, human; transcription factor RUNX2; apoptosis; cell proliferation; chondrocyte; genetics; human; metabolism; osteoarthritis; Apoptosis; Cell Proliferation; Chondrocytes; Core Binding Factor Alpha 1 Subunit; Humans; Interleukin-1beta; Osteoarthritis; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt",background disruption chondrocyte proliferation differentiation critical event process joint injury osteoarthritis oa p 15 peptide could bind integrin receptor various precursor cell promote cell adhesion release growth factor promote differentiation osteoblast precursor cell however role p 15 oa particularly chondrocyte proliferation fully understood method activity sfpq runx2 bone tissue patient osteoarthritis analyzed using quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction qrt pcr interleukin 1β il 1β inducer performed establish vitro model oa cell proliferation measured cck 8 assay expression col2a1 acan comp sox9 bmp2 related cartilage differentiation detected using qrt pcr addition expression level sfpq akt p akt runx2 detected using western blotting result result showed expression sfpq significantly decreased expression runx2 significantly increased osteoarthritis cartilage tissue p 15 peptide reversed il 1β induced cell proliferation obstruction alleviated chondrocyte damage furthermore p 15 polypeptide increased expression level cartilage differentiation gene col2a1 acan bmp2 decreasing expression comp sox9 inverse dose dependent manner specific interfering rna proved p 15 maintains chondrocyte stability associated sfpq gene finally confirmed p 15 inhibited akt runx2 pathway regulated expression sfpq conclusion p 15 mitigate chondrocyte damage osteoarthritis progression inhibiting cell death modulating sfpq akt runx2 pathway offering opportunity develop new strategy treatment osteoarthritis 2023 author,qrt pcr interleukin; pathway offering opportunity; inducer performed establish; inverse dose dependent; proliferation measured cck; decreasing expression comp; reaction qrt pcr; qrt pcr addition; bone tissue patient; mitigate chondrocyte damage; chain reaction qrt; background disruption chondrocyte; maintains chondrocyte stability; critical event process; event process joint; process joint injury; bind integrin receptor; adhesion release growth; release growth factor; fully understood method,pcr interleukin 1β; strategy treatment osteoarthritis; treatment osteoarthritis 2023; pcr addition expression; cartilage differentiation gene,chondrocyte; proliferation; differentiation; osteoarthritis; OA; p15 peptide; integrin receptor; osteoblast precursor cell; SFPQ; Runx2; qRTPCR; IL1β; CCK,0.0351579777303109,0.0,0.31658844029157984

However, no unified characterization of blended Math-Sci sensemaking exists. Results: We developed a theoretical cognitive model for blended Math-Sci sensemaking grounded in prior work. The model contains three broad levels representing increasingly sophisticated ways of engaging in blended Math-Sci sensemaking: (1) developing qualitative relationships among relevant variables in mathematical equations describing a phenomenon (“qualitative level”); (2) developing mathematical relationships among these variables (“quantitative level”); and (3) explaining how the mathematical operations used in the formula relate to the phenomenon (“conceptual level”). Each level contains three sublevels. We used PhET simulations to design dynamic assessment scenarios in various disciplines to test the model. We used these assessments to interview undergraduate students with a wide range of Math skills. Interview analysis provided validity evidence for the categories and preliminary evidence for the ordering of the categories comprising the cognitive model. It also revealed that students tend to perform at the same level across different disciplinary contexts, suggesting that blended Math-Sci sensemaking is a distinct cognitive construct, independent of specific disciplinary context. Conclusion: This paper presents a first-ever published validated cognitive model describing proficiency in blended Math-Sci sensemaking which can guide instruction, curriculum, and assessment development. © 2023, The Author(s).",Blended sensemaking; Cognitive framework; Math sensemaking; Science sensemaking; Validity,,background blended mathematical sensemaking science math sci sensemaking involves deep conceptual understanding quantitative relationship describing scientific phenomenon studied various discipline however unified characterization blended math sci sensemaking exists result developed theoretical cognitive model blended math sci sensemaking grounded prior work model contains three broad level representing increasingly sophisticated way engaging blended math sci sensemaking 1 developing qualitative relationship among relevant variable mathematical equation describing phenomenon qualitative level 2 developing mathematical relationship among variable quantitative level 3 explaining mathematical operation used formula relate phenomenon conceptual level level contains three sublevels used phet simulation design dynamic assessment scenario various discipline test model used assessment interview undergraduate student wide range math skill interview analysis provided validity evidence category preliminary evidence ordering category comprising cognitive model also revealed student tend perform level across different disciplinary context suggesting blended math sci sensemaking distinct cognitive construct independent specific disciplinary context conclusion paper present first ever published validated cognitive model describing proficiency blended math sci sensemaking guide instruction curriculum assessment development 2023 author,math sci sensemaking; blended math sci; science math sci; math sci; sci sensemaking involves; sci sensemaking exists; sci sensemaking grounded; sci sensemaking distinct; sci sensemaking guide; wide range math; range math skill; math skill interview; characterization blended math; engaging blended math; suggesting blended math; proficiency blended math; sci sensemaking; sensemaking science math; disciplinary context suggesting; specific disciplinary context,math sci sensemaking; sensemaking science math; mathematical sensemaking science; blended math sci; math skill interview,Blended Math Sci Sensemaking ;Cognitive Model ;Qualitative Relationship ;Quantitative Level ;Conceptual Level ;Mathematical Equation ;Mathematical Operation ;PHET Simulation ;Dynamic Assessment ;Dis,0.5993470791367858,0.6851033706432976,0.3072971281320301

Both neurofibromin 1 and cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP) play a role in the development of the skeleton. Carrying both germline mutations has not been previously reported; however, it can affect the developing phenotype. Case presentation: The index patient, an 8-year-old female presented with several skeletal and dermatologic anomalies resembling the coexistence of multiple syndromes. Her mother had dermatologic symptoms characteristic for neurofibromatosis type 1, and her father presented with distinct skeletal anomalies. NGS-based analysis revealed a heterozygous pathogenic mutation in genes NF1 and COMP in the index patient. A previously unreported heterozygous variant was detected for the NF1 gene. The sequencing of the COMP gene revealed a previously reported, pathogenic heterozygous variant that is responsible for the development of the pseudoachondroplasia phenotype. Conclusions: Here, we present the case of a young female carrying pathogenic NF1 and COMP mutations, diagnosed with two distinct heritable disorders, neurofibromatosis type 1 and pseudoachondroplasia. The coincidence of two monogenic autosomal dominant disorders is rare and can pose a differential diagnostic challenge.

To quantify how well an inferred graph can explain a trace, we introduce feasibility, a novel quality criterion, and suggest that it is linked to the result’s accuracy. In addition, we propose CEM-*, a network inference method that guarantees 100% feasibility given online social media traces, which are a non-trivial extension of the Expectation-Maximization algorithm developed by Newman (Nature Phys 14:67–75, 2018). We propose a set of linear optimization updates that incorporate a set of auxiliary variables and a set of feasibility constraints; the latter takes into consideration all the hidden paths that are possible between users based on their timestamps of interaction and guides the inference toward feasibility. We provide two CEM-* variations, that assume either an Erdős–Rényi (ER) or a Stochastic Block Model (SBM) prior for the underlying graph’s unknown distribution. Extensive experiments on one synthetic and one real-world Twitter dataset show that for both priors CEM-* can generate a posterior distribution of graphs that explains the whole trace while being closer to the ground truth. As an additional benefit, the use of the SBM prior infers and clusters users simultaneously during optimization. CEM-* outperforms baseline and state-of-the-art methods in terms of feasibility, run-time, and precision of the inferred graph and communities. Finally, we propose a heuristic to adapt the inference to lower feasibility requirements and show how it can affect the precision of the result. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.",Expectation maximization; Network inference; Network reconstruction; Online social networks; Stochastic block model,Computational electromagnetics; Graphic methods; Image segmentation; Inference engines; Linear programming; Maximum principle; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; 'current; Expectation Maximization; Inference algorithm; Network inference; Network reconstruction; Online users; Quality criteria; Social graphs; Stochastic block models; User interaction; Social networking (online),current network inference algorithm fail generate graph edge explain whole sequence node interaction given dataset trace quantify well inferred graph explain trace introduce feasibility novel quality criterion suggest linked result accuracy addition propose cem network inference method guarantee 100 feasibility given online social medium trace non trivial extension expectation maximization algorithm developed newman nature phys 14 67 75 2018 propose set linear optimization update incorporate set auxiliary variable set feasibility constraint latter take consideration hidden path possible user based timestamps interaction guide inference toward feasibility provide two cem variation assume either erdős rényi er stochastic block model sbm prior underlying graph unknown distribution extensive experiment one synthetic one real world twitter dataset show prior cem generate posterior distribution graph explains whole trace closer ground truth additional benefit use sbm prior infers cluster user simultaneously optimization cem outperforms baseline state art method term feasibility run time precision inferred graph community finally propose heuristic adapt inference lower feasibility requirement show affect precision result 2023 author exclusive licence springer verlag gmbh austria part springer nature,author exclusive licence; newman nature phys; block model sbm; quality criterion suggest; criterion suggest linked; online social medium; trivial extension expectation; extension expectation maximization; consideration hidden path; stochastic block model; real world twitter; closer ground truth; ground truth additional; truth additional benefit; outperforms baseline state; baseline state art; verlag gmbh austria; gmbh austria part; current network inference; model sbm prior,graph explain trace; feasibility given online; graph community finally; network inference algorithm; inferred graph community,2020 ;Network inference algorithm;Graph edge;Sequence node interaction;Dataset trace;Quality criterion;Linked result accuracy;CEM network inference method;Online social medium trace;Expectation maximization algorithm;Linear optimization;Auxiliary,0.3357616929864775,0.2146045378907234,0.4046749409366493

The proposed velocity-temperature coupling control method (Liu et al, Phys Rev Fluids 6:044603, 2021) is further extended to the hypersonic turbulent boundary layer. Direct numerical simulation results of four comparative cases show that the heated wall blowing achieves a drag reduction rate of 10.58%, which is about the sum of wall blowing (5.27%) and wall heating (6.35%). By evaluating the control efficiency, however, it is found that heated wall blowing is not as good as wall blowing and cannot obtain net energy saving rate. The modified FIK decompositions of skin friction coefficient indicate that the cliffy decrease of the mean convection term is the primary contribution for the drag reduction. Effects of the proposed control measure on turbulence statistics and coherent structures are also analyzed.

Both food insecurity and health outcomes are the policy and agenda of the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). However, there is a lack of macro-level empirical studies (Macro-level study means studies at the broadest level using variables that represent a given country or the whole population of a country or economy as a whole. For example, if the urban population (% of the total population) of XYZ country is 30%, it is used as a proxy variable to represent represent country's urbanization level. Empirical study implies studies that employ the econometrics method, which is the application of math and statistics.) concerning the relationship between food insecurity and health outcomes in sub-Saharan African (SSA) countries though the region is highly affected by food insecurity and its related health problems. Therefore, this study aims to examine the impact of food insecurity on life expectancy and infant mortality in SSA countries. Methods: The study was conducted for the whole population of 31 sampled SSA countries selected based on data availability. The study uses secondary data collected online from the databases of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO), and the World Bank (WB). The study uses yearly balanced data from 2001 to 2018. This study employs a multicountry panel data analysis and several estimation techniques; it employs Driscoll-Kraay standard errors (DKSE), a generalized method of momentum (GMM), fixed effects (FE), and the Granger causality test. Results: A 1% increment in people’s prevalence for undernourishment reduces their life expectancy by 0.00348 percentage points (PPs). However, life expectancy rises by 0.00317 PPs with every 1% increase in average dietary energy supply. A 1% rise in the prevalence of undernourishment increases infant mortality by 0.0119 PPs. However, a 1% increment in average dietary energy supply reduces infant mortality by 0.0139 PPs. Conclusions: Food insecurity harms the health status of SSA countries, but food security impacts in the reverse direction.

The purpose of this study is threefold: (1) to investigate whether a factor model is adequate for explaining the relationship between extracted process indicators from log files and students’ performance on the three items; (2) to evaluate whether measurement invariance holds for the three analysed countries; and (3) to determine how well contextual variables [i.e., a student’s background, availability, use of information and communication technology (ICT) resources, and learning conditions for mathematical literacy] correlate with the model’s latent constructs. Our findings reveal that a three-factor CFA model is well-suited to the analysed data and that a weak measurement invariance model performs best. By including contextual variables in the modelling, we also highlight the differences in Scandinavian students’ profiles. Specifically, higher economic social cultural status (ESCS) consistently led to higher math proficiency across all three countries. Norway did not show any gender differences in math proficiency, response time, or exploration behaviours. Experience with math tasks at school led to more exploration behaviours across all three countries. Swedish and Norwegian students who had more experience with pure math tasks at school were likely to obtain higher mathematics achievement scores and tended to interact more frequently with the testing platform when answering the three math items. When Danish students had higher ICT scores (i.e., more ICT resources available at school and home), they had lower response accuracy. There was, however, no effect of ICT on the three factors among Swedish and Norwegian students. Finally, we also discuss the implications and limitations of this study. © 2023, The Author(s).",Computer-based assessment; ILSA; Measurement invariance; Process data; Scandinavian,,given ongoing development computer based task increasing interest modelling student behaviour indicator log file data contextual variable collected via questionnaire work apply latent regression model analyse relationship latent construct e performance speed exploration behaviour contextual variable among scandinavian student e norway sweden denmark completion three interactive mathematics task 2012 program international student assessment pisa purpose study threefold 1 investigate whether factor model adequate explaining relationship extracted process indicator log file student performance three item 2 evaluate whether measurement invariance hold three analysed country 3 determine well contextual variable e student background availability use information communication technology ict resource learning condition mathematical literacy correlate model latent construct finding reveal three factor cfa model well suited analysed data weak measurement invariance model performs best including contextual variable modelling also highlight difference scandinavian student profile specifically higher economic social cultural status escs consistently led higher math proficiency across three country norway show gender difference math proficiency response time exploration behaviour experience math task school led exploration behaviour across three country swedish norwegian student experience pure math task school likely obtain higher mathematics achievement score tended interact frequently testing platform answering three math item danish student higher ict score e ict resource available school home lower response accuracy however effect ict three factor among swedish norwegian student finally also discus implication limitation study 2023 author,indicator log file; math task school; swedish norwegian student; process indicator log; behaviour indicator log; country swedish norwegian; contextual variable collected; including contextual variable; log file data; behaviour contextual variable; exploration behaviour contextual; measurement invariance hold; weak measurement invariance; data contextual variable; contextual variable modelling; purpose study threefold; file data contextual; speed exploration behaviour; time exploration behaviour; extracted process indicator,increasing modelling student; study threefold investigate; ict resource learning; school led exploration; completion interactive mathematics,computerbased task; modelling student behaviour; log file data; contextual variable; latent regression model; three interactive mathematics task; international student assessment; factor model; measurement invariance; contextual variable; economic social cultural status; gender difference; math proficiency; response time; exploration behaviour,0.1593357709013289,0.0,0.16911657706820674

Biomedical named entity recognition (BioNER) is one of the key and fundamental tasks in biomedical text mining. It also acts as a primitive step for many downstream applications such as relation extraction and knowledge base completion. Therefore, the accurate identification of entities in biomedical literature has certain research value. However, this task is challenging due to the insufficiency of sequence labeling and the lack of large-scale labeled training data and domain knowledge. Results: In this paper, we use a novel word-pair classification method, design a simple attention mechanism and propose a novel architecture to solve the research difficulties of BioNER more efficiently without leveraging any external knowledge. Specifically, we break down the limitations of sequence labeling-based approaches by predicting the relationship between word pairs. Based on this, we enhance the pre-trained model BioBERT, through the proposed prefix and attention map dscrimination fusion guided attention and propose the E-BioBERT. Our proposed attention differentiates the distribution of different heads in different layers in the BioBERT, which enriches the diversity of self-attention. Our model is superior to state-of-the-art compared models on five available datasets: BC4CHEMD, BC2GM, BC5CDR-Disease, BC5CDR-Chem, and NCBI-Disease, achieving F1-score of 92.55%, 85.45%, 87.53%, 94.16% and 90.55%, respectively. Conclusion: Compared with many previous various models, our method does not require additional training datasets, external knowledge, and complex training process. The experimental results on five BioNER benchmark datasets demonstrate that our model is better at mining semantic information, alleviating the problem of label inconsistency, and has higher entity recognition ability. More importantly, we analyze and demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed attention. © 2023, The Author(s).",Biomedical named entity recognition; E-BioBERT; PAMDFGA; Word-pair relation classification,Character recognition; Data mining; Knowledge management; Natural language processing systems; Semantics; Text processing; Biomedical literature; Biomedical named entity recognition; Biomedical text minings; E-BioBERT; External knowledge; PAMDFGA; Relation classifications; Sequence Labeling; Word-pair relation classification; Word-pairs; Domain Knowledge; benchmarking; data mining; knowledge base; procedures; semantics; Benchmarking; Data Mining; Knowledge Bases; Semantics,background biomedical literature growing rapidly increasingly important extract meaningful information vast amount literature biomedical named entity recognition bioner one key fundamental task biomedical text mining also act primitive step many downstream application relation extraction knowledge base completion therefore accurate identification entity biomedical literature certain research value however task challenging due insufficiency sequence labeling lack large scale labeled training data domain knowledge result paper use novel word pair classification method design simple attention mechanism propose novel architecture solve research difficulty bioner efficiently without leveraging external knowledge specifically break limitation sequence labeling based approach predicting relationship word pair based enhance pre trained model biobert proposed prefix attention map dscrimination fusion guided attention propose e biobert proposed attention differentiates distribution different head different layer biobert enriches diversity self attention model superior state art compared model five available datasets bc4chemd bc2gm bc5cdr disease bc5cdr chem ncbi disease achieving f1 score 92 55 85 45 87 53 94 16 90 55 respectively conclusion compared many previous various model method require additional training datasets external knowledge complex training process experimental result five bioner benchmark datasets demonstrate model better mining semantic information alleviating problem label inconsistency higher entity recognition ability importantly analyze demonstrate effectiveness proposed attention 2023 author,chem ncbi disease; ncbi disease achieving; insufficiency sequence labeling; sequence labeling lack; word pair classification; limitation sequence labeling; relationship word pair; due insufficiency sequence; labeling lack large; break limitation sequence; predicting relationship word; recognition ability importantly; growing rapidly increasingly; rapidly increasingly important; increasingly important extract; important extract meaningful; act primitive step; downstream application relation; application relation extraction; challenging due insufficiency,biomedical literature growing; biomedical text mining; bioner efficiently leveraging; vast literature biomedical; recognition bioner key,Biomedical Literature ;Named Entity Recognition ;Bioner ;Text Mining ;Relation Extraction ;Knowledge Base Completion ;Sequence Labeling ;Word Pair Classification ;Attention Mechanism ;Novel,0.219692048454818,0.2316912190193869,0.5369846663182688

However, the sub-lethal effects of baculoviruses are also highly debilitating for the host. The objective of the study was to demonstrate the sub-lethal effects of an indigenous strain of Spodoptera frugiperda nucleopolyhedrovirus (SpfrNPV) infecting fall armyworm in India. Results: As a result of larval infection, the larval developmental time was significantly prolonged as compared to the untreated insects. The percentage of pupal mortality ranged from 40.74 to 72.73 at varying doses of SpfrNPV and recorded low pupal weight in all the treatments than control. The fertility and fecundity of infected adult moths was significantly reduced when compared to the untreated insects in a concentration dependent fashion. Sub-lethal effects of baculoviral infection on different biological parameters were studied. Mean developmental period of infected 3rd and 4th larval instars was significantly higher (F = 2.945; F = 18.414; df = 5, 20; P < 0.05) in SpfrNPV infected larvae than the control at all tested viral concentrations. The percentage of pupal mortality ranged from 40.74 to 72.73 in the lowest and highest concentrations of SpfrNPV, respectively. Developmental period of male pupae was found to be significantly longer in infected groups than the uninfected ones. The infected adults had significantly reduced longevity in both males ranged from 3.5 to 5.75 (F = 6.273; P = 0.002) and females ranged from 3.5 to7.00 (F = 13.652; P = 0.001). Further, the mates of virus-treated adults showed a highly reduced egg production (F = 31.255; P < 0.05) ranged from 150.03 to 338.33 and the larval emerging ranged from 71.11 to 227.89 (F = 74.52; P < 0.05), which was again significantly lower than the control. The percentage of egg hatching ranged from 47.40 to 86.41%. Conclusions: The sub-lethal effect of SpfrNPV has observed on the growth and development and also reduced percentage of egg hatching in the subsequent generation. Hence, this indigenous SpfrNPV strain can be used in the sustainable and resilience IPM program.

Although the species collision operator in the AAP model conserves fully the mass, momentum, and energy for the mixture, it does not conserve the momentum and energy for each species due to the inter-species collisions. In this work, the species collision operator is decomposed into two parts: one part is fully conservative for the species and the other represents the excess part. With this decomposition, the kinetic equation is solved using the Strang-splitting method, in which the excess part of the collision operator is treated as a source, while the kinetic equation with the species conservative part is solved by the standard DUGKS. Particularly, the time integration of the source term is realized by either explicit or implicit Euler scheme. By this means, it is easy to extend the scheme to gas mixtures composed of Maxwell or hard-sphere molecules, while the previous DUGKS [Zhang Y, Zhu L, Wang R et al, Phys Rev E 97(5):053306, 2018] of binary gases was only designed for Maxwell molecules. Several tests are performed to validate the scheme, including the shock structure under different Mach numbers and molar concentrations, the Couette flow under different mass ratios, and the pressure-driven Poiseuille flow in different flow regimes. The results are compared with those from other reliable numerical methods based on different models. And the influence of molecular model on the flow characteristics is studied. The results also show that the present DUGKS with implicit source discretization is more stable and preferable for gas mixture problems involving different flow regimes. © 2023, The Author(s).",AAP model; Discrete unified gas-kinetic scheme; Multi-species gas; Strang-splitting method,Binary mixtures; Conservation; Integral equations; Kinetic energy; Kinetic theory; Kinetics; Molecules; Numerical methods; Andry-aoki-perthame model; Collision operators; Discrete unified gas-kinetic scheme; Flow regimes; Gas kinetic scheme; Multi-species; Multi-species gas; Splitting method; Strang splitting; String-splitting method; Gas mixtures,discrete unified gas kinetic scheme dugks developed multi specie flow flow regime based andries aoki perthame aap kinetic model although specie collision operator aap model conserve fully mass momentum energy mixture conserve momentum energy specie due inter specie collision work specie collision operator decomposed two part one part fully conservative specie represents excess part decomposition kinetic equation solved using strang splitting method excess part collision operator treated source kinetic equation specie conservative part solved standard dugks particularly time integration source term realized either explicit implicit euler scheme mean easy extend scheme gas mixture composed maxwell hard sphere molecule previous dugks zhang zhu l wang r et al phys rev e 97 5 053306 2018 binary gas designed maxwell molecule several test performed validate scheme including shock structure different mach number molar concentration couette flow different mass ratio pressure driven poiseuille flow different flow regime result compared reliable numerical method based different model influence molecular model flow characteristic studied result also show present dugks implicit source discretization stable preferable gas mixture problem involving different flow regime 2023 author,specie collision operator; collision operator decomposed; collision operator treated; collision operator aap; andries aoki perthame; test performed validate; including shock structure; mach number molar; number molar concentration; molar concentration couette; ratio pressure driven; pressure driven poiseuille; compared reliable numerical; discretization stable preferable; discrete unified gas; binary gas designed; momentum energy mixture; mass momentum energy; conserve momentum energy; splitting method excess,decomposition kinetic equation; kinetic equation specie; dugks zhang zhu; kinetic model specie; maxwell molecule test,Discrete Unified Gas Kinetic Scheme (DUGKS) ;Multispecie Flow ;Flow Regime ;Andries Aoki ;Perthame AAP Kinetic Model ;Specie Collision Operator ;Fully Mass Momentum,0.2096661354797382,0.1842345513887656,0.41531378263533875

Understanding the formation of advising relationships can help contextualize their later development and ultimately support a student’s decision to persist in the doctorate. To understand relationship formation, the purpose of this qualitative study is to identify and describe the types of advisor–advisee selection processes that exist in engineering, science, and math doctoral programs and examine patterns across disciplines within those fields. We conducted interviews with doctoral program directors and engaged in document analysis of graduate student handbooks from 55 doctoral programs in the aforementioned fields in high research institutions across the United States. Using principal–agent theory as a theoretical lens, our findings showed that engineering programs tend to decentralize the advisor selection process by funding students across different funding sources upon enrollment. Contrariwise, science and math programs tended to fund all students in a cohort from a common funding source, which allowed students to have more time to gather information, meet, and select an advisor. These findings also show important nuances when comparing graduate education in these programs that directly impact the doctoral student experience and reiterates the necessity to study these fields separately. © 2023, The Author(s).",Advisor selection; Doctoral students; Graduate education; Qualitative secondary analysis,,although advising relationship key doctoral student success little research addressed form understanding formation advising relationship help contextualize later development ultimately support student decision persist doctorate understand relationship formation purpose qualitative study identify describe type advisor advisee selection process exist engineering science math doctoral program examine pattern across discipline within field conducted interview doctoral program director engaged document analysis graduate student handbook 55 doctoral program aforementioned field high research institution across united state using principal agent theory theoretical lens finding showed engineering program tend decentralize advisor selection process funding student across different funding source upon enrollment contrariwise science math program tended fund student cohort common funding source allowed student time gather information meet select advisor finding also show important nuance comparing graduate education program directly impact doctoral student experience reiterates necessity study field separately 2023 author,advisee selection process; contrariwise science math; selection process exist; enrollment contrariwise science; addressed form understanding; development ultimately support; decision persist doctorate; persist doctorate understand; identify describe type; director engaged document; engaged document analysis; principal agent theory; agent theory theoretical; theory theoretical lens; time gather information; gather information meet; information meet select; show important nuance; important nuance comparing; experience reiterates necessity,graduate student handbook; interview doctoral program; science math doctoral; math doctoral program; doctoral student success,Advising relationship;Doctoral student success;Qualitative study;Advisoradvisee selection process;Engineering; science; math;Principalagent theory;Graduate education program;Doctoral student experience;Study field separately;2023,0.0683884967948167,0.3268975363347646,0.3772919995497055

However, there is an inter-individual variation in the response to exercise and the tolerability to high-intensity exercise. Identifying potential moderating factors, such as inflammation and treatment type, for changes in muscle strength is important to improve the effectiveness of exercise programs. Therefore, we aimed to investigate if inflammation and type of oncological treatment moderate the effects of exercise intensity (high vs. low-moderate) on muscular strength changes in patients with breast (BRCA) or prostate cancer (PRCA). Methods: Participants with BRCA (n = 286) and PRCA (n = 65) from the Physical training and Cancer study (Phys-Can) were included in the present study. Participants performed a combined resistance- and endurance exercise program during six months, at either high or low-moderate intensity. Separate regression models were estimated for each cancer type, with and without interaction terms. Moderators included in the models were treatment type (i.e., neo/adjuvant chemotherapy—yes/no for BRCA, adjuvant androgen deprivation therapy (ADT)—yes/no for PRCA)), and inflammation (interleukin 6 (IL6) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFα)) at follow-up. Results: For BRCA, neither IL6 (b = 2.469, 95% CI [− 7.614, 12.552]) nor TNFα (b = 0.036, 95% CI [− 6.345, 6.418]) levels moderated the effect of exercise intensity on muscle strength change. The same was observed for chemotherapy treatment (b = 4.893, 95% CI [− 2.938, 12.724]). Similarly, for PRCA, the effect of exercise intensity on muscle strength change was not moderated by IL6 (b = − 1.423, 95% CI [− 17.894, 15.048]) and TNFα (b = − 1.905, 95% CI [− 8.542, 4.732]) levels, nor by ADT (b = − 0.180, 95% CI [− 11.201, 10.841]). Conclusions: The effect of exercise intensity on muscle strength is not moderated by TNFα, IL6, neo/adjuvant chemotherapy, or ADT, and therefore cannot explain any intra-variation of training response regarding exercise intensity (e.g., strength gain) for BRCA or PRCA in this setting.

The larval host range of western corn rootworm, Diabrotica virgifera virgifera (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae), is restricted to maize and a few grasses. Resistance of D. v. virgifera to crop rotation practices and multiple insecticides contributes to its status as the most damaging pest of cultivated maize in North America and Europe. The extent to which adaptations by this pest contributes to host plant specialization remains unknown. Results: A 2.42 Gb draft D. v. virgifera genome, Dvir_v2.0, was assembled from short shotgun reads and scaffolded using long-insert mate-pair, transcriptome and linked read data. K-mer analysis predicted a repeat content of ≥ 61.5%. Ortholog assignments for Dvir_2.0 RefSeq models predict a greater number of species-specific gene duplications, including expansions in ATP binding cassette transporter and chemosensory gene families, than in other Coleoptera. A majority of annotated D. v. virgifera cytochrome P450s belong to CYP4, 6, and 9 clades. A total of 5,404 transcripts were differentially-expressed between D. v. virgifera larvae fed maize roots compared to alternative host (Miscanthus), a marginal host (Panicum virgatum), a poor host (Sorghum bicolor) and starvation treatments; Among differentially-expressed transcripts, 1,908 were shared across treatments and the least number were between Miscanthus compared to maize. Differentially-expressed transcripts were enriched for putative spliceosome, proteosome, and intracellular transport functions. General stress pathway functions were unique and enriched among up-regulated transcripts in marginal host, poor host, and starvation responses compared to responses on primary (maize) and alternate hosts. Conclusions: Manual annotation of D. v. virgifera Dvir_2.0 RefSeq models predicted expansion of paralogs with gene families putatively involved in insecticide resistance and chemosensory perception. Our study also suggests that adaptations of D. v. virgifera larvae to feeding on an alternate host plant invoke fewer transcriptional changes compared to marginal or poor hosts. The shared up-regulation of stress response pathways between marginal host and poor host, and starvation treatments may reflect nutrient deprivation. This study provides insight into transcriptomic responses of larval feeding on different host plants and resources for genomic research on this economically significant pest of maize. © 2022, This is a U.S. Government work and not under copyright protection in the US; foreign copyright protection may apply.",Differential expression; Genome assembly; Host plant specialization,"ABC transporter; cytochrome P450; cytochrome P450 family 4; cytochrome P450 family 6; cytochrome P450 family 9; proteasome; transcriptome; unclassified drug; endotoxin; insecticide; adult; animal experiment; Article; beetle; chemoreceptor; cladistics; controlled study; Diabrotica virgifera virgifera; differential gene expression; down regulation; evolutionary adaptation; feeding; female; gene duplication; genetic transcription; genome; host; host plant specialization; intracellular transport; larva; maize; Miscanthus; molecular genetics; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; orthology; Panicum virgatum; pest control; plant root; plant stress; predictive model; sorghum; species differentiation; spliceosome; starvation; tandem repeat; upregulation; whole genome sequencing; animal; beetle; biological pest control; genetics; maize; metabolism; physiology; Poaceae; transgenic plant; Animals; Coleoptera; Endotoxins; Insecticides; Larva; Pest Control, Biological; Plants, Genetically Modified; Poaceae; Zea mays",background adaptation arthropod pest host plant defense crop determine impact agricultural production larval host range western corn rootworm diabrotica virgifera virgifera coleoptera chrysomelidae restricted maize grass resistance v virgifera crop rotation practice multiple insecticide contributes status damaging pest cultivated maize north america europe extent adaptation pest contributes host plant specialization remains unknown result 2 42 gb draft v virgifera genome dvir_v2 0 assembled short shotgun read scaffolded using long insert mate pair transcriptome linked read data k mer analysis predicted repeat content 61 5 ortholog assignment dvir_2 0 refseq model predict greater number specie specific gene duplication including expansion atp binding cassette transporter chemosensory gene family coleoptera majority annotated v virgifera cytochrome p450s belong cyp4 6 9 clade total 5 404 transcript differentially expressed v virgifera larva fed maize root compared alternative host miscanthus marginal host panicum virgatum poor host sorghum bicolor starvation treatment among differentially expressed transcript 1 908 shared across treatment least number miscanthus compared maize differentially expressed transcript enriched putative spliceosome proteosome intracellular transport function general stress pathway function unique enriched among regulated transcript marginal host poor host starvation response compared response primary maize alternate host conclusion manual annotation v virgifera dvir_2 0 refseq model predicted expansion paralogs gene family putatively involved insecticide resistance chemosensory perception study also suggests adaptation v virgifera larva feeding alternate host plant invoke fewer transcriptional change compared marginal poor host shared regulation stress response pathway marginal host poor host starvation treatment may reflect nutrient deprivation study provides insight transcriptomic response larval feeding different host plant resource genomic research economically significant pest maize 2022 u government work copyright protection u foreign copyright protection may apply,poor host starvation; host poor host; marginal host poor; differentially expressed transcript; marginal poor host; transcript differentially expressed; virgifera genome dvir; refseq model predict; virgatum poor host; poor host sorghum; alternate host plant; poor host shared; ortholog assignment dvir; diabrotica virgifera virgifera; virgifera virgifera coleoptera; compared marginal poor; host starvation treatment; host plant defense; host plant specialization; host plant invoke,corn rootworm diabrotica; corn rootworm; pest cultivated maize; western corn rootworm; maize grass resistance,background; adaptation; arthropod; pest; host plant; defense; crop; determine; impact; agricultural production; larval; host range; western corn rootworm; Diabrotica virgifera virgifera; Coleoptera; Chrysomel,0.3936755177778059,0.0,0.20040141993261515

Methods: Postmolar GTN received P-Chem was defined as P-Chem group. Postmolar GTN without P-chem was randomly selected as control group according to the ratio of 1:3 (P-chem:control) and matched by age for low risk and high risk GTN separately. Results: Totally 455 low-risk and 32 high-risk postmolar GTN patients were included. WHO risk score, chemotherapy cycles to achieve hCG normalization and resistant rate were similar between P-chem (27 cases) and control (81 cases) group. Among low-risk GTN patients, interval from hydatidiform mole to GTN was significantly longer in P-chem group than control (44 vs 69 days, P = 0.001). Total chemotherapy cycles and resistant rate were similar between low-risk GTN treated with same agent as P-chem (group A) and alternative agent (group B). But group A needed more chemotherapy cycles to achieve hCG normalization than group B. Conclusions: P-chem delayed the time to GTN diagnosis, but didn’t increase risk score or lead to drug resistance of postmolar GTN. Alternative agent different from P-chem had the potential of enhancing chemotherapy response in low- risk postmolar GTN. © 2023, The Author(s).",Chemotherapy resistance; Gestational trophoblastic neoplasia; Hydatidiform mole; Prophylactic chemotherapy,antineoplastic agent; chorionic gonadotropin; adult; Article; cancer chemotherapy; cancer prevention; cancer resistance; cancer risk; controlled study; female; gestational trophoblastic neoplasia; high risk population; human; hydatidiform mole; low risk population; major clinical study; multiple cycle treatment; retrospective study; treatment outcome; hydatidiform mole; pregnancy; risk factor; trophoblastic tumor; Chorionic Gonadotropin; Female; Gestational Trophoblastic Disease; Humans; Hydatidiform Mole; Pregnancy; Retrospective Studies; Risk Factors; Treatment Outcome,objective evaluate whether prophylactic chemotherapy p chem increased drug resistance rate postmolar gtn whether first line chemotherapy different p chem method postmolar gtn received p chem defined p chem group postmolar gtn without p chem randomly selected control group according ratio 1 3 p chem control matched age low risk high risk gtn separately result totally 455 low risk 32 high risk postmolar gtn patient included risk score chemotherapy cycle achieve hcg normalization resistant rate similar p chem 27 case control 81 case group among low risk gtn patient interval hydatidiform mole gtn significantly longer p chem group control 44 v 69 day p 0 001 total chemotherapy cycle resistant rate similar low risk gtn treated agent p chem group alternative agent group b group needed chemotherapy cycle achieve hcg normalization group b conclusion p chem delayed time gtn diagnosis increase risk score lead drug resistance postmolar gtn alternative agent different p chem potential enhancing chemotherapy response low risk postmolar gtn 2023 author,cycle achieve hcg; achieve hcg normalization; resistant rate similar; risk postmolar gtn; chemotherapy cycle achieve; low risk gtn; low risk postmolar; high risk postmolar; risk high risk; chem method postmolar; cycle resistant rate; hcg normalization resistant; resistance rate postmolar; low risk high; similar low risk; drug resistance postmolar; age low risk; response low risk; chem increased drug; patient included risk,risk score chemotherapy; evaluate prophylactic chemotherapy; score chemotherapy cycle; chemotherapy cycle achieve; prophylactic chemotherapy chem,Prophylactic chemotherapy ;Postmolar GTN ;First line chemotherapy ;Drug resistance rate ;Low risk ;High risk ;Risk score ;Chemotherapy cycle ;HCG normalization ;Res,0.0557696055297932,0.5251639400449671,0.3791756490277561

Due to its complexity and dependence on both aerosol and raindrop sizes, wet scavenging process has been poorly treated, especially during the removal of fine particles. This makes the numerical simulation of below-cloud scavenging in large-scale aerosol models unrealistic. To consider the slip effects of submicron particles, a simplified expression for the diffusion scavenging was developed by approximating the Cunningham slip correction factor. The derived analytic solution was parameterized as a simple power function of rain intensity under the assumption of the lognormal size distribution of particles. The resultant approximated expression was compared to the observed data and the results of previous studies including a 3D atmospheric chemical transport model simulation. Compared with the default GEOS-Chem coefficient of 0.00106R0.61 and the observation-based coefficient of 0.0144R0.9268, the coefficient of a and b in Λm = aRb spread in the range of 0.0002- 0.1959 for a and 0.3261- 0.525 for b over a size distribution of GSD of 1.3–2.5 and a geometric mean diameter of 0.01- 2.5 µm. Overall, this study showed that the scavenging coefficient varies widely by orders of magnitude according to the size distribution of particles and rain intensity. This study also demonstrated that the obtained simplified expression could consider the theoretical approach of aerosol polydispersity. Our proposed analytic approach showed that results can be effectively applied for reduced computational burden in atmospheric modeling. © 2022",Below-cloud scavenging; Cunningham correction factor; Parameterization; Polydisperse aerosol; Scavenging coefficient,Atmospheric chemistry; Atmospheric movements; Parameterization; Polydispersity; Rain; Size distribution; Below-cloud scavenging; Correction factors; Cunningham correction factor; Distribution of particles; Polydisperse aerosols; Rain-intensity; Scavenging coefficients; Scavenging process; Simplified expressions; Size-distribution; Aerosols; aerosol; atmospheric transport; cloud classification; concentration (composition); parameterization; precipitation intensity; scavenging (chemistry),cloud aerosol scavenging process precipitation one important mechanism remove aerosol atmosphere due complexity dependence aerosol raindrop size wet scavenging process poorly treated especially removal fine particle make numerical simulation cloud scavenging large scale aerosol model unrealistic consider slip effect submicron particle simplified expression diffusion scavenging developed approximating cunningham slip correction factor derived analytic solution parameterized simple power function rain intensity assumption lognormal size distribution particle resultant approximated expression compared observed data result previous study including 3d atmospheric chemical transport model simulation compared default geos chem coefficient 0 00106r0 61 observation based coefficient 0 0144r0 9268 coefficient b λm arb spread range 0 0002 0 1959 0 3261 0 525 b size distribution gsd 1 3 2 5 geometric mean diameter 0 01 2 5 µm overall study showed scavenging coefficient varies widely order magnitude according size distribution particle rain intensity study also demonstrated obtained simplified expression could consider theoretical approach aerosol polydispersity proposed analytic approach showed result effectively applied reduced computational burden atmospheric modeling 2022,size distribution particle; size distribution gsd; arb spread range; lognormal size distribution; function rain intensity; rain intensity assumption; distribution particle rain; burden atmospheric modeling; process poorly treated; power function rain; intensity assumption lognormal; demonstrated obtained simplified; distribution particle resultant; important mechanism remove; atmosphere due complexity; due complexity dependence; developed approximating cunningham; correction factor derived; solution parameterized simple; parameterized simple power,simulation cloud scavenging; precipitation important mechanism; process precipitation important; distribution particle rain; cloud aerosol scavenging,Cloud;Aerosol;Scavenging;Process;Precipitation;Removal;Atmosphere;Raindrop;Size;Wet;Fine Particle;Numerical Simulation;Large Scale;Model;Slip,0.0720764175333871,0.3632551218883336,0.240434756511489

A graph G is called reciprocal if 1/λ is an eigenvalue of G whenever λ is an eigenvalue of G. Further, if λ and 1/λ have the same multiplicities, for each eigenvalue λ, then it is called strong reciprocal. In (MATCH Commun. Math. Comput. Chem. 83 (2020) 631-633), it was conjectured that for every graph G with maximum degree Δ(G) and minimum degree Δ(G) whose adjacency matrix is non-singular, ε(G) ≥ Δ(G) + δ(G) and the equality holds if and only if G is a complete graph. Here, we prove the validity of this conjecture for some strong reciprocal graphs. Moreover, we show that if G is a strong reciprocal graph, then ε(G) ≥ Δ(G) + δ(G) - 1/2. Recently, it has been proved that if G is a reciprocal graph of order n and its spectral radius, ρ, is at least 4λmin, where λmin is the smallest absolute value of eigenvalues of G, then ε(G) ≥n + 1/2.

This study prepared sustained-release tea tree essential oil (TTO) solid preservative (SP) with an encapsulation efficiency of 71.45% and applied it on fresh-cut pineapple in modified atmospheres packaging (MAP). Results showed that TTO adsorbed on nano silicon dioxide (SiO2) was embedded in the starch-carboxymethyl cellulose network structure by extrusion. The hydrogen bond and hydrophobic interaction resulted in compact structure and good sustained-release performance of SP. The SP improved sensory quality and reduced nutrient loss and microbial spoilage of fresh-cut pineapple, which extended its shelf-life to four days. In addition, antioxidant capacity was enhanced with increasing antioxidant enzyme activity, antioxidant content, and 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazine scavenging capacity and decreasing MDA accumulation.

This work proposes a hub-and-spoke network design (HSND) for container shipping in inland waterways based on the tree-like structure river. Firstly, the characteristics of the hub-and-spoke network in the inland waterways are presented in detail. Then, an integer linear programming model is proposed to simultaneously determine the optimal hub location, feeder port allocation, and fleet deployment to minimize the total cost of ships, transportation, and transshipment. A decomposition-based math-heuristic method and an enhanced genetic algorithm are then proposed to solve the HSND. A case study based on the traffic on the Yangtze River and extensive computational experiments are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed models and methods.

Indeed, radiation events, due to the release of high Z impurities, such as Nickel and Copper, and W sputtered from the divertor, can strongly reduce the power crossing the plasma separatrix and slow the ELMs dynamics, thus inducing H to L transition. In particular, in JET baseline plasmas, because of the outward neoclassical transport [A.R. Field et al 2021 Plasma Phys. Control. Fusion 63 095013], plasma impurities are mainly localized in the mantle region, as detected by a real-time surrogate model for bolometer tomography based on machine learning [D.R. Ferreira et al 2021 Fusion Engineering and Design 164], and the consequent excessive radiation in this region is the main cause of plasma termination in recent Deuterium, Tritium and Deuterium-Tritium operations. To guarantee impurity accumulation being flushed by the ELMs, ELM control schemes, which ensure a throughput of particles, either via gas fueling and via pellets, have been exploited.

Appl. 18, 027,001 (2022)) has remarked that the nonreciprocal emitters of existing schemes are greatly limited by the small angular range since they typically occurred at rather large angles. Here, to address the key challenge, a novel scheme, based on the cascaded dielectric-magneto-optical (MO) material grating structure, is proposed and investigated. It is shown that near-unity emission and little absorption can be achieved simultaneously at the same wavelength, leading to near-perfect nonreciprocal radiation for an angle of only 1°. The underlying physical mechanism is revealed through illustrating the distributions of magnetic field amplitude. Besides, the possibility to realize strong nonreciprocity with the magnetic field as small as possible is investigated. Last, the angular ranges which can be realized by the proposed scheme are also investigated.

Flux calculation is one of the fundamental elements in molecular simulations. Several-decades-long research efforts on the subject made significant progresses since the pioneering work of Irving and Kirkwood [J. Chem. Phys, (1950) 18, 817–829]. However, some issues remain regarding the fluxes in the flow direction. The streaming velocity (SV) and the fluxes independent of SV are difficult to manage during computation. For example, the local fluxes and SV that vary in more than one direction are not well represented despite being prevalent in the microscopic phenomena such as nanofluidics, biotechnologies, and energy conversions. The technique presented in this paper is based on the instantaneous microscopic conservation equations and depends only on the total fluxes that include the convective contributions. This allows a calculation of all the fluxes at the end of a simulation run, with no complication arising in terms of defining and collecting SV, pressure tensor, and heat flux vector. Widely-used methods such as the method of planes and volume-average method were adapted, respectively. This study then investigated a planar shear flow in a highly confined channel, where a flow is unknown at the beginning of a simulation, and the controversial streamwise heat flux with no temperature gradient was present. The flow and fluxes were structured, and the streamwise heat flux evolved significantly and slowly over a few tens of nano-seconds even with steady boundary conditions. © 2023 Elsevier Masson SAS",Molecular simulation; Nanofluidics; Particle simulation,Heat flux; Molecular structure; Shear flow; Conservation equations; Flow direction; Flux calculations; Flux velocity; Molecular simulations; Particle simulations; Research efforts; Streaming velocity; Total flux; Velocity-pressure; Nanofluidics,paper present new technique calculating microscopic local flux provides robust accessible way obtain streamwise flux general flow flux calculation one fundamental element molecular simulation several decade long research effort subject made significant progress since pioneering work irving kirkwood j chem phys 1950 18 817 829 however issue remain regarding flux flow direction streaming velocity sv flux independent sv difficult manage computation example local flux sv vary one direction well represented despite prevalent microscopic phenomenon nanofluidics biotechnology energy conversion technique presented paper based instantaneous microscopic conservation equation depends total flux include convective contribution allows calculation flux end simulation run complication arising term defining collecting sv pressure tensor heat flux vector widely used method method plane volume average method adapted respectively study investigated planar shear flow highly confined channel flow unknown beginning simulation controversial streamwise heat flux temperature gradient present flow flux structured streamwise heat flux evolved significantly slowly ten nano second even steady boundary condition 2023 elsevier masson sa,streamwise heat flux; controversial streamwise heat; structured streamwise heat; pressure tensor heat; steady boundary condition; tensor heat flux; heat flux vector; heat flux temperature; heat flux evolved; calculating microscopic local; simulation controversial streamwise; fundamental element molecular; decade long research; long research effort; research effort subject; effort subject made; subject made significant; made significant progress; pioneering work irving; work irving kirkwood,nanofluidics biotechnology energy; phenomenon nanofluidics biotechnology; nanofluidics biotechnology; molecular simulation decade; biotechnology energy conversion,paris; ;Molecular simulation ;Irving Kirkwood ;J Chem Phys 1950 ;Instantaneous microscopic conservation equation ;Convective contribution ;Pressure tensor ;Heat flux vector ;Plane volume average method ;Planar she,0.0661891727367295,0.3847935972158522,0.17929025635779888

In a more broad way these results show that a system of wave modes interacting through all possible combinations of the third order nonlinear terms described by a general wave Hamiltonian necessarily produces anharmonic wave modes with temporal and spatial scaling properties that follow scale free power laws.

In this study, we checked the influence of winter harshness on the sex ratio of Mallards overwintering in urban waterbodies with an emphasis on differences at the local scale within a single town. Our study shows that in harsh winter seasons, there was a lower share of males among wintering Mallards. It seems that females, despite their smaller body size and higher specific metabolic rate, found favourable conditions in the urban area during cold weather. Towns are characterized by a milder winter climate than rural areas, moreover birds profit from the supplementary feeding by humans. In severe weather conditions, females remained in urban waterbodies together with their paired mate, whereas unpaired males possibly left the town in search of sites with less competition, as they occupy a lower position in the flock hierarchy than paired individuals. We also found such differences on a local scale, with the proportion of males decreasing with decreasing temperature. Obtained results suggest that the sex- and status-dependent response to even a slight temperature change during the winter period is probably the most important factor shaping the variation in the proportion of male and female Mallards in flocks, at least in areas with a high abundance of anthropogenic food, which is likely to weaken competition between the sexes for resources. © 2023 Elsevier Masson SAS",Gdańsk; Sexual segregation; Wildfowl ecology; Winter harshness,bird; gender discrimination; Northern Hemisphere; overwintering; severe weather; sex ratio; temperature gradient; urban area,mallard duck northern hemisphere male outnumber female wintering flock temperature seems one important factor shaping sex ratio given site study checked influence winter harshness sex ratio mallard overwintering urban waterbodies emphasis difference local scale within single town study show harsh winter season lower share male among wintering mallard seems female despite smaller body size higher specific metabolic rate found favourable condition urban area cold weather town characterized milder winter climate rural area moreover bird profit supplementary feeding human severe weather condition female remained urban waterbodies together paired mate whereas unpaired male possibly left town search site le competition occupy lower position flock hierarchy paired individual also found difference local scale proportion male decreasing decreasing temperature obtained result suggest sex status dependent response even slight temperature change winter period probably important factor shaping variation proportion male female mallard flock least area high abundance anthropogenic food likely weaken competition sex resource 2023 elsevier masson sa,important factor shaping; difference local scale; emphasis difference local; factor shaping variation; local scale proportion; found difference local; duck northern hemisphere; smaller body size; body size higher; size higher specific; higher specific metabolic; specific metabolic rate; bird profit supplementary; profit supplementary feeding; supplementary feeding human; feeding human severe; obtained result suggest; status dependent response; high abundance anthropogenic; abundance anthropogenic food,female wintering flock; outnumber female wintering; wintering mallard female; winter harshness sex; female mallard flock,paris; ;Mallard Duck ;Northern Hemisphere ;Male Outnumber Female ;Wintering Flock ;Temperature ;Sex Ratio ;Urban Waterbodies ;Milder Winter Climate ;Supplementary Feeding ;Human,0.0,0.1231987959559034,0.07438886779205853

This winding type has high leakage flux and excessive harmonics, especially when used in superconducting machines. Other attempts like applying full-pitch racetrack coils can only be with one slot per pole per phase which also has significant slotting harmonics. This paper proposes an innovative concept of double-layer concentric coils to enable distributed windings with a larger integral number of slots per pole per phase. The concept successfully breaks the limitation that racetrack coils cannot be built with such integral slots. This paper then assesses the performance of the proposed winding concept within a context 20 MW FSCG design.

Both quench heaters and CLIQ (coupling loss induced quench) are under study. This paper presents the research work on the CLIQ protection. The work includes CLIQ design methods and configurations, and comparative studies of various CLIQ configurations for maximizing the CLIQ effectiveness. The results show that the most effective CLIQ configuration is able to quench 80% of the coil turns at the nominal current within 3 ms, leaving 20 ms for detection and validation time while keeping the maximum hotspot temperature within 350 K. The study shows that protection of R2D2 using only CLIQ may be feasible under certain assumptions. © 2002-2011 IEEE.",Accelerator magnet; CLIQ; FCC; Nb3Sn; quench protection; R2D2,"Grading; Latexes; Magnetic separation; Niobium; Phosphorus; Superconducting coils; Superconducting magnets; > <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$_{3}$</tex-math> </inline-formula> sn; Coupling loss; Coupling loss induced quench; FCC; Land surface temperature; Nb <inline-formula xmlns:ali=""; Quench protection; R2d2; Xmlns:mml=""; Xmlns:xlink=""; Xmlns:xsi=""; Capacitance",research racetrack dipole demonstrator r2d2 studied demonstrating magnet future fcc magnet r2d2 meant prove feasibility grading block coil nb3sn dipole explore quench behavior high current short model provides opportunity study quench protection concept needed full scale fcc magnet quench heater cliq coupling loss induced quench study paper present research work cliq protection work includes cliq design method configuration comparative study various cliq configuration maximizing cliq effectiveness result show effective cliq configuration able quench 80 coil turn nominal current within 3 m leaving 20 m detection validation time keeping maximum hotspot temperature within 350 k study show protection r2d2 using cliq may feasible certain assumption 2002 2011 ieee,meant prove feasibility; studied demonstrating magnet; racetrack dipole demonstrator; full scale fcc; prove feasibility grading; feasibility grading block; concept needed full; needed full scale; coupling loss induced; detection validation time; validation time keeping; time keeping maximum; keeping maximum hotspot; maximum hotspot temperature; magnet future fcc; future fcc magnet; scale fcc magnet; demonstrating magnet future; method configuration comparative; design method configuration,research racetrack dipole; magnet future fcc; future fcc magnet; studied demonstrating magnet; demonstrator r2d2 studied,Research ;Racetrack Dipole Demonstrator (R2D2) ;Magnet ;Future FCC Magnet ;Quench ;Behavior ;High Current ;Short Model ;Quench Protection ;Full,0.2342996664217046,0.3648813070930083,0.4989035633556888

One of these collaborations involves INFN, the Italian Institute of Nuclear Physics, which has been working on the cos \theta design until 2019 as part of the European EuroCirCol project. This study consisted of a conceptual design of a 16 T, double-aperture, four-layer dipole made of Nb_{3} Sn. Considering the challenge that such a cutting-edge magnet represents, this conceptual design resulted in a 5-year agreement between INFN and CERN in order to study and build a 1.5 m long, single aperture, cos \theta, Nb_{3} Sn dipole with a target magnetic field of 12 T. This project is called the Future Accelerator post-LHC Cos \theta Optimized Nb_{3} Sn Dipole (or FalconD for short). In this paper we present the mechanical analysis of this project after some major cross-sectional upgrades that have impacted the design by easing the assembly phase. One of the most challenging aspects of this design is its mechanical structure that must handle the intense magnetic forces generated by such a high magnetic field. The mechanical structure is based on the 'bladder & key' (B&K) concept and it has never been adopted before in a cos\theta dipole, so it needs to be validated. This contribution presents the 2D FEM of the FalconD, showing the mechanical behavior of the magnet during each construction step. © 2002-2011 IEEE.",Accelerator dipoles; Mechanical systems; Nb3Sn; superconducting magnets,"Accelerator magnets; Conceptual design; Superconducting magnets; Tellurium compounds; > <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$_{3}$</tex-math> </inline-formula> sn; Accelerator dipoles; Coil; Computational modelling; Finite element analyse; Interference; Magnetic tunneling; Mechanical systems; Nb <inline-formula xmlns:ali=""; Xmlns:mml=""; Xmlns:xlink=""; Xmlns:xsi=""; Finite element method",part research project called fcc hh led cern aim study possibility building new 100 tev center mass energy particle collider along 80 100 km circumference tunnel many collaboration underway test different design main bending dipole collider one collaboration involves infn italian institute nuclear physic working co theta design 2019 part european eurocircol project study consisted conceptual design 16 double aperture four layer dipole made nb_ 3 sn considering challenge cutting edge magnet represents conceptual design resulted 5 year agreement infn cern order study build 1 5 long single aperture co theta nb_ 3 sn dipole target magnetic field 12 project called future accelerator post lhc co theta optimized nb_ 3 sn dipole falcond short paper present mechanical analysis project major cross sectional upgrade impacted design easing assembly phase one challenging aspect design mechanical structure must handle intense magnetic force generated high magnetic field mechanical structure based bladder key b k concept never adopted co theta dipole need validated contribution present 2d fem falcond showing mechanical behavior magnet construction step 2002 2011 ieee,part european eurocircol; tev center mass; fem falcond showing; year agreement infn; long single aperture; magnet construction step; called future accelerator; structure based bladder; center mass energy; mass energy particle; italian institute nuclear; institute nuclear physic; nuclear physic working; challenge cutting edge; future accelerator post; accelerator post lhc; major cross sectional; cross sectional upgrade; sectional upgrade impacted; easing assembly phase,building new 100; accelerator post lhc; design 2019 european; new 100 tev; future accelerator post,paper; ;Research project;FCC HH;CERN;100 TeV;Particle collider;80100 km circumference tunnel;INFN;Italian Institute of Nuclear Physics;Cotheta design;European Eurocircol project; ,0.0960848958389015,0.1359496832231445,0.0

A highly uniform magnetic field is required, which is less than 0.2 \,\mathrm{ppm_{p-p}} (peak-to-peak) in a muon storage region of (333\pm 15)\,\mathrm{mm} in radius and \pm 50 \,\mathrm{mm} in height around the magnet center. The magnetic field error due to manufacturing tolerance was evaluated with a Monte Carlo simulation. This paper introduces the evaluation of magnetic field error due to manufacturing tolerance with a Monte Carlo simulation implemented in C++17. Assuming tolerance to be within 0.1\,\mathrm{mm} or 0.1 mrad, the uniformity was calculated to be 179 \,\mathrm{ppm_{p-p}} at the worst case. We performed shimming simulation by using truncated singular value decomposition regularization. As a result, it was confirmed that the worst field error could be compensated to the uniformity of 0.17 \,\mathrm{ppm_{p-p}} with a present shimming system. Furthermore, we performed the shimming simulation for wider range of the manufacturing tolerances to investigate the shimming system limit. We concluded that the magnet had to be manufactured with an accuracy less than at least 0.5\,\mathrm{mm} or 0.5 mrad. © 2002-2011 IEEE.",Magnet design; superconducting magnets; the J-PARC Muon g-2 /EDM Experiment,"Charged particles; Digital storage; Errors; Intelligent systems; Magnetic fields; Magnetic storage; Monte Carlo methods; > <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$g-2$</tex-math> </inline-formula>/EDM experiment; Magnet designs; Magnetic field errors; Manufacturing tolerances; Monte Carlo's simulation; Superconducting solenoids; The J-PARC muon <inline-formula xmlns:ali=""; Xmlns:mml=""; Xmlns:xlink=""; Xmlns:xsi=""; Superconducting magnets",j parc muon g 2 edm experiment us superconducting solenoid magnet store positive muon generates magnetic field 3 rm highly uniform magnetic field required le 0 2 mathrm ppm_ p p peak peak muon storage region 333 pm 15 mathrm mm radius pm 50 mathrm mm height around magnet center magnetic field error due manufacturing tolerance evaluated monte carlo simulation paper introduces evaluation magnetic field error due manufacturing tolerance monte carlo simulation implemented c 17 assuming tolerance within 0 1 mathrm mm 0 1 mrad uniformity calculated 179 mathrm ppm_ p p worst case performed shimming simulation using truncated singular value decomposition regularization result confirmed worst field error could compensated uniformity 0 17 mathrm ppm_ p p present shimming system furthermore performed shimming simulation wider range manufacturing tolerance investigate shimming system limit concluded magnet manufactured accuracy le least 0 5 mathrm mm 0 5 mrad 2002 2011 ieee,field error due; error due manufacturing; magnetic field error; due manufacturing tolerance; monte carlo simulation; performed shimming simulation; mathrm ppm; mrad uniformity calculated; worst field error; evaluated monte carlo; generates magnetic field; uniform magnetic field; magnetic field required; center magnetic field; evaluation magnetic field; wider range manufacturing; tolerance monte carlo; carlo simulation paper; carlo simulation implemented; manufacturing tolerance monte,experiment superconducting solenoid; superconducting solenoid magnet; edm experiment superconducting; evaluation magnetic field; concluded magnet manufactured,j parc muon g 2 edm experiment ;superconducting solenoid magnet ;positive muon ;magnetic field ;highly uniform magnetic field ;monte carlo simulation ;manufacturing tolerance ;shimming simulation,0.0,0.4466980420660973,0.4419688267707341

One of the most utilized approaches for magnetoquasistatic simulations in applied superconductivity is the H formulation. However, due to the large number of degrees of freedom (DOFs) present when modeling large and complex systems (e.g. large coils for fusion applications, electrical machines, and medical applications) using the standard H formulation on a desktop machine becomes infeasible. The H formulation solves the Faraday's law formulated in terms of the magnetic field intensity \mathbf {H} using edge elements in the whole modeling domain. For this reason, a very high resistivity is assumed for the non-conducting domains, leading to an ill-conditioned system matrix and therefore long computation times. In contrast, the H-\phi formulation uses the H formulation in the conducting region, and the \phi formulation (magnetic scalar potential) in the surrounding non-conducting domains, drastically reducing DOFs and computation time. In this work, we use the H-\phi formulation in 2D for the magnetothermal (AC losses and quench) analysis of stacks of REBCO tapes. The same approach is extended to a 3D case for the AC loss analysis of a twisted superconducting wire. All the results obtained by simulations in Sparselizard are compared with results obtained with COMSOL. Our custom tool allows us to distribute the simulations over hundreds of CPUs using domain decomposition methods, considerably reducing the simulation times without compromising accuracy. © 2002-2011 IEEE.",AC Loss; cloud; DDM; formulation; HTS; modeling; quench; REBCO,"Critical current density (superconductivity); Degrees of freedom (mechanics); Domain decomposition methods; Initial value problems; Magnetic domains; Magnetization; Maxwell equations; Medical applications; Numerical methods; Superconducting coils; Superconducting magnets; Wire; <inline-formula xmlns:ali=""; > <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$H$</tex-math> </inline-formula>-<inline-formula xmlns:ali=""; > <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$\phi$</tex-math> </inline-formula>-formulation; AC loss; Computational modelling; DDM; High-temperature superconductor; HTS; Modeling; Quench; REBCO; Xmlns:mml=""; Xmlns:xlink=""; Xmlns:xsi=""; High temperature superconductors",growing interest modeling superconductors led development effective numerical method software one utilized approach magnetoquasistatic simulation applied superconductivity h formulation however due large number degree freedom dofs present modeling large complex system e g large coil fusion application electrical machine medical application using standard h formulation desktop machine becomes infeasible h formulation solves faraday law formulated term magnetic field intensity mathbf h using edge element whole modeling domain reason high resistivity assumed non conducting domain leading ill conditioned system matrix therefore long computation time contrast h phi formulation us h formulation conducting region phi formulation magnetic scalar potential surrounding non conducting domain drastically reducing dofs computation time work use h phi formulation 2d magnetothermal ac loss quench analysis stack rebco tape approach extended 3d case ac loss analysis twisted superconducting wire result obtained simulation sparselizard compared result obtained comsol custom tool allows u distribute simulation hundred cpu using domain decomposition method considerably reducing simulation time without compromising accuracy 2002 2011 ieee,conducting region phi; region phi formulation; wire result obtained; compared result obtained; result obtained comsol; tape approach extended; superconducting wire result; sparselizard compared result; obtained comsol custom; phi formulation magnetic; superconductors led development; led development effective; development effective numerical; number degree freedom; solves faraday law; faraday law formulated; law formulated term; field intensity mathbf; reason high resistivity; high resistivity assumed,formulation solves faraday; development effective numerical; analysis twisted superconducting; domain drastically reducing; simulation time compromising,Superconductors ;Modeling ;Magnetoquasistatic Simulation ;H Formulation ;Degree of Freedom (DOFs) ;Faraday Law ;Magnetic Field Intensity ;Edge Element ;High Resistivity,0.0683286552421149,0.0905851295336976,0.13806698524699737

It is multifilamentary, available in a wide range of fine filaments and twisted filament architectures and can be made into Rutherford and other cables. The properties of Bi-2212 conductors depend on powder quality, conductor fabrication and heat treatment. The heat treatment is still complex but much better understood, particularly the vital parameters of the maximum heat treatment temperature (Tmax), time-in-the-melt (tmelt) and the cooling rate as Bi-2212 reforms on cooling. Here we report on the performance and microstructure variation with heat treatments for more than a dozen wires made with powders produced by Engi-Mat in recent years. Wire architectures include 37 × 18, 55 × 18 and 85x18 and wire diameters range from 0.8 to 1.0 mm. Tmax was varied between 884 and 897 °C. Wires with smaller filament diameter showed a peak JE at the low end of Tmax and also a JE that was more sensitive to Tmax. JE (Tmax) plots for all recent wires show a plateau between Tmax of 886 and 894 °C, where JE (4.2 K, 5 T) is 1100-1400 A/mm2. Some wires with filament size of 13-15 μm showed a 10 °C heat treatment window (Δ Tmax) with a plateau JE (4.2 K, 5 T) of about 1100 A/mm2. © 2002-2011 IEEE.",Bi-2212 wire; critical current density; superconducting magnet; Superconductor,Cooling; Heat treatment; High temperature superconductors; Microstructure; Powders; Superconducting cables; Superconducting coils; Bi-2212 round wires; Bi-2212 wires; Bi:2212; Billet; Coil; Critical current density; Heat treatment temperature; High temperature superconducting wire; Microstructure variations; Performance variations; Superconducting magnets,bi 2212 high temperature superconducting wire round geometry multifilamentary available wide range fine filament twisted filament architecture made rutherford cable property bi 2212 conductor depend powder quality conductor fabrication heat treatment heat treatment still complex much better understood particularly vital parameter maximum heat treatment temperature tmax time melt tmelt cooling rate bi 2212 reform cooling report performance microstructure variation heat treatment dozen wire made powder produced engi mat recent year wire architecture include 37 18 55 18 85x18 wire diameter range 0 8 1 0 mm tmax varied 884 897 c wire smaller filament diameter showed peak je low end tmax also je sensitive tmax je tmax plot recent wire show plateau tmax 886 894 c je 4 2 k 5 1100 1400 mm2 wire filament size 13 15 μm showed 10 c heat treatment window δ tmax plateau je 4 2 k 5 1100 mm2 2002 2011 ieee,high temperature superconducting; reform cooling report; round geometry multifilamentary; rutherford cable property; vital parameter maximum; time melt tmelt; report performance microstructure; performance microstructure variation; produced engi mat; parameter maximum heat; microstructure variation heat; fabrication heat treatment; maximum heat treatment; variation heat treatment; heat treatment dozen; heat treatment window; heat treatment heat; treatment heat treatment; wide range fine; made rutherford cable,temperature superconducting wire; 2212 high temperature; high temperature superconducting; superconducting wire round; powder quality conductor,BI 2212;High Temperature Superconducting Wire;Round Geometry;Multifilamentary;Wide Range;Fine Filament;Twisted Filament Architecture;Rutherford Cable Property;Powder Quality;Conductor Fabrication;Heat Treatment,0.0170821002264682,0.3436667462817624,0.24891294870309616

The synthesized nanocarriers had a loading capacity of 790 μg mg−1 for baicalein (BA) and performed excellent pH-triggered drug release behavior under the acidic condition of pH 5.0. Polydopamine (PDA) coating endowed the drug delivery system (DDS) with good photothermal performance, and the photothermal conversion efficiency (η) was 39.48% under 808 nm laser irradiation for 10 min. Then, PEGylation was performed using amino-terminated PEG (PEG-NH2) to provide high biocompatibility and stability. In addition, PEGylation and PDA-coating assisted in improving the hemolytic toxicity and cytotoxicity of bare nanocarriers. Furthermore, in vitro cellular studies showed that DDS of BZPP had excellent cellular internalization in A549 cells and enhanced synergistic anti-tumor ability to cancer cells compared to monotherapy.

Individuals may initially be attracted to others who are like themselves (i.e., have assortative preferences). Alternatively, couples may become more similar over time. These explanations have been difficult to disentangle. Assortative mating may be less common in online situations as barriers related to social homogamy are removed. The current study experimentally investigates which, if any, of the Big Five personality traits were assortatively preferred in an online environment. Methods: Online volunteers and paid participants (205 females and 178 males) viewed 100 ostensible dating profiles comprised of random pairings of facial images and personal descriptions, the latter of which were pre-rated for perceived personality. Participants indicated whether they would like to “match” with each profile, mimicking responses made on dating applications, and completed the Big Five Inventory (BFI-44). Results: Participants showed assortative preferences for agreeableness, openness, and extraversion, but not for conscientiousness or emotional stability. Conclusion: These results suggest that people exhibit assortative preferences in an online dating app environment. If these online preferences translate to long-term relationships, this could help explain similarities found in established couples identified in previous research. © 2023 The Authors",Attraction; Big Five personality; Dating applications; Mate preferences; Partner similarity; Personality preferences,adult; article; emotional stability; extraversion; face; female; homogamy; human; human experiment; major clinical study; male; mate choice; online dating; personality,introduction established couple tend similar personality e assortative mating however mechanism effect unclear individual may initially attracted others like e assortative preference alternatively couple may become similar time explanation difficult disentangle assortative mating may le common online situation barrier related social homogamy removed current study experimentally investigates big five personality trait assortatively preferred online environment method online volunteer paid participant 205 female 178 male viewed 100 ostensible dating profile comprised random pairing facial image personal description latter pre rated perceived personality participant indicated whether would like match profile mimicking response made dating application completed big five inventory bfi 44 result participant showed assortative preference agreeableness openness extraversion conscientiousness emotional stability conclusion result suggest people exhibit assortative preference online dating app environment online preference translate long term relationship could help explain similarity found established couple identified previous research 2023 author,identified previous research; introduction established couple; experimentally investigates big; application completed big; similarity found established; mechanism effect unclear; effect unclear individual; time explanation difficult; explanation difficult disentangle; situation barrier related; barrier related social; related social homogamy; social homogamy removed; homogamy removed current; removed current study; current study experimentally; study experimentally investigates; trait assortatively preferred; comprised random pairing; random pairing facial,preference online dating; online dating app; dating app; dating app environment; response dating application,Assortative mating; Big Five personality trait; assortative preference; online dating; online environment; facial image; personal description; perceived personality; match profile; mimic response; longterm relationship; similarity; established couple.,0.0674366722131869,0.1860835860222285,0.353232329655008

The program can also carry out calculations in the multiple-structure local harmonic (MS-LH) approximation or multi-structural local quasiharmonic (MS-LQ) approximation or by the dual-level MS-T method. Furthermore, the program package includes eight utility codes that can be used as stand-alone programs to help the user to generate the input files for the code or to generate comparison results. The 2023 version of MSTor includes a new capability, namely automatic identification of torsional modes with redundant internal coordinates. New version program summary: Program title: MSTor 2023 CPC Library link to program files: https://doi.org/10.17632/t4y5wds856.1 Licensing provisions: Apache 2.0 Programming language: Fortran 90, C, and Perl Journal references of previous versions: Comput. Phys. Comm. 183 (2012) 1803; Comput. Phys. Comm. 184 (2013) 2032 Does the new version supersede the previous version?: Yes. Nature of problem: Calculation of the partition functions and thermodynamic functions (standard-state energy, enthalpy, entropy, and free energy as functions of temperature) of molecules or transition states involving multiple torsional motions. Solution method: The program uses the multi-structural approximation with torsional anharmonicity, a coupled torsional potential, and delocalized torsions MS-T(CD) [1]. The program also provides results for the multi-structural local harmonic approximation or local quasiharmonic approximation, and it can also be used for the original multi-structural approximation with torsional anharmonicity and a coupled torsional potential MS-T(C) [2] or an uncoupled torsional potential MS-T(U) [3]. The program can also carry out dual-level [4] MS-T(CD), MS-T(C), and MS-T(U) calculations. Reasons for new version: The new version increases functionality and is more user friendly. The main enhancement is the capability for automatic identification of torsional modes with redundant internal coordinates. Summary of revisions: A newly developed torsional identification approach for complex molecules has been implemented in the MSTor program. The method, called multi-structural torsion method with a coupled torsional potential and delocalized torsions MS-T(CD), is based on Baker et al.'s delocalized internal-coordinates method and on Zheng and Truhlar's torsional projection method. By using a redundant-internal-coordinate auto-generation procedure, the MS-T(CD) method circumvents the need in the original MS-T method for the user to define nonredundant internal coordinates, and it can straightforwardly identify and separate the coupled torsions from the Cartesian Hessian. This greatly simplifies the user input, and it helps users to obtain robust and consistent results. MSTor now sets the redundant internal coordinate scheme as the default method. A new utility code, DLMSTor.exe, is provided to allow dual-level calculations. The $framechain and $framedef sections were reintroduced to the code as optional sections. If these sections are used, the D matrix is calculated using the scheme of Kilpatrick and Pitzer and one should always get correct values for the moments of inertia. Various utility codes were modified to help ensure that structures that are equivalent under rotation to other structures (and thus indistinguishable when considering overall rotation and torsions) are still properly included in the Voronoi tessellation step (which does not fully exploit overall rotational symmetry). The mcvorm.exe utility code was modified to correctly calculate uncertainties and to take advantage of rotational symmetries (at least for linear-chain molecules) and mirror-image symmetries, if present, in the calculation of the uncertainty estimates. We added a new keyword, MTUMME, that provides an option to write a density-of-states file for version 2023 (in preparation) of the TUMME [5] master equation program. Some minor bugs are fixed so the code now compiles properly with the GNU gfortran compiler (version 12.2.1), the NVidia HPC Fortran compiler pgfortran (version 21.3), and the Intel compiler ifort. The output format is cleaned, and unused variables and arrays are removed. The new version has an increased number of test runs, and the manual is improved and updated. The program authors are J.

The corresponding Mathematica package automatically performs the matching to next-to-leading order. This includes two-loop thermal corrections to scalar and Debye masses as well as one-loop thermal corrections to couplings. DRalgo also allows for integrating out additional heavy scalars. Along the way, the package provides leading-order beta functions for general gauge-charges and fermion-families; both in the fundamental and in the effective theory. Finally, the package computes the finite-temperature effective potential within the effective theory. The article explains the theory of the underlying algorithm while introducing the software on a pedagogical level.

These tick species are vectors for many zoonotic pathogens, and their northward range expansion presents a serious threat to public health. Climate change (particularly increasing temperature) has been identified as an important driver permitting northward range expansion of blacklegged ticks, but the impacts of host movement, which is essential to tick dispersal into new climatically suitable regions, have received limited investigation. Here, a mechanistic movement model was applied to landscapes of eastern North America to explore 1) relationships between multiple ecological drivers and the speed of the northward invasion of blacklegged ticks infected with the causative agent of Lyme disease, Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto, and 2) its capacity to simulate the northward range expansion of infected blacklegged ticks and uninfected lone star ticks under theoretical scenarios of increasing temperature. Our results suggest that the attraction of migratory birds (long-distance tick dispersal hosts) to resource-rich areas during their spring migration and the mate-finding Allee effect in tick population dynamics are key drivers for the spread of infected blacklegged ticks. The modeled increases in temperature extended the climatically suitable areas of Canada for infected blacklegged ticks and uninfected lone star ticks towards higher latitudes by up to 31% and 1%, respectively, and with an average predicted speed of the range expansion reaching 61 km/year and 23 km/year, respectively. Differences in the projected spatial distribution patterns of these tick species were due to differences in climate envelopes of tick populations, as well as the availability and attractiveness of suitable habitats for migratory birds. Our results indicate that the northward invasion process of lone star ticks is primarily driven by local dispersal of resident terrestrial hosts, whereas that of blacklegged ticks is governed by long-distance migratory bird dispersal. The results also suggest that mechanistic movement models provide a powerful approach for predicting tick-borne disease risk patterns under complex scenarios of climate, socioeconomic and land use/land cover changes. © 2023",Amblyomma americanum; Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto; Climate warming; Ixodes scapularis; Reaction-advection-diffusion model; Spatial expansion,adult; Amblyomma americanum; Article; Borrelia burgdorferi; Canada; climate change; controlled study; female; geographic distribution; habitat; Ixodes scapularis; land use; landscape; latitude; Lyme disease; male; mating; migrant bird; nonhuman; North America; parasite survival; parasitism; population dynamics; population structure; prediction; seasonal variation; sensitivity analysis; socioeconomics; temperature; tick; tick borne disease,geographic range blacklegged tick ixodes scapularis expanding northward united state southern canada study suggest lone star tick amblyomma americanum follow suit tick specie vector many zoonotic pathogen northward range expansion present serious threat public health climate change particularly increasing temperature identified important driver permitting northward range expansion blacklegged tick impact host movement essential tick dispersal new climatically suitable region received limited investigation mechanistic movement model applied landscape eastern north america explore 1 relationship multiple ecological driver speed northward invasion blacklegged tick infected causative agent lyme disease borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto 2 capacity simulate northward range expansion infected blacklegged tick uninfected lone star tick theoretical scenario increasing temperature result suggest attraction migratory bird long distance tick dispersal host resource rich area spring migration mate finding allee effect tick population dynamic key driver spread infected blacklegged tick modeled increase temperature extended climatically suitable area canada infected blacklegged tick uninfected lone star tick towards higher latitude 31 1 respectively average predicted speed range expansion reaching 61 km year 23 km year respectively difference projected spatial distribution pattern tick specie due difference climate envelope tick population well availability attractiveness suitable habitat migratory bird result indicate northward invasion process lone star tick primarily driven local dispersal resident terrestrial host whereas blacklegged tick governed long distance migratory bird dispersal result also suggest mechanistic movement model provide powerful approach predicting tick borne disease risk pattern complex scenario climate socioeconomic land use land cover change 2023,lone star tick; infected blacklegged tick; northward range expansion; uninfected lone star; blacklegged tick uninfected; tick uninfected lone; mechanistic movement model; range expansion blacklegged; range blacklegged tick; geographic range blacklegged; expansion infected blacklegged; expansion blacklegged tick; suggest lone star; process lone star; northward invasion blacklegged; range expansion infected; invasion blacklegged tick; range expansion reaching; star tick amblyomma; star tick theoretical,blacklegged tick infected; blacklegged tick ixodes; expansion blacklegged tick; infected blacklegged tick; invasion blacklegged tick,geographic range ;blacklegged tick ;Ixodes scapularis ;expanding northward ;United States ;southern Canada ;study ;suggest ;lone star tick ;Amblyomma american,0.0881309844034643,0.0567006713100589,0.16414559307762686

It can penetrate the skin with minimal invasion for continuous health care monitoring. However, the current microneedles production process is complex, thus it can't be widely used. This paper demonstrates a one-step preparation method for multi-groove microneedle(MN) arrays based on the refraction index variations of polyethylene glycol di-acrylate (PEGDA) in the process of photopolymerization. The multi-groove microneedle can penetrate the skin and extract skin interstitial fluid (ISF) by capillary action. Hydrodynamic simulations showed that the liquid was risen in the multi-groove MNs by capillary force. Glu-cose was successfully extracted from mice and analyzed using a paper-based glucose sensor in-tegrated with the multi-groove MNs.

Herein, lignin's novel chemical modification (amination) has been developed to produce high quantity pyrrolic-N moieties as active sites. Furthermore, chemically modified amine moieties in lignin are vital as a natural self-activating template to generate hierarchical porosity in the 2D (graphene-like) architecture with exceedingly high surface area (2926.4 m2g−1). The rationally introduced dominated pyrrolic-N moieties boost the Zn-ion storage capacity and reaction kinetics due to the dual energy storage mechanism and efficient charge transfer between pyrrolic-N and Zn+2 ions. Furthermore, the pyrrolic-N species are energetically favorable for the adsorption of Zn+2 ions by the formation of N-Zn+2 chemical bonds. Besides, the nitrogen oxides reduce the intrinsic resistance and induce a more polarized surface, resulting in high wettability and efficient transfer of electrolytes into the pores of hydrophobic carbon materials. Subsequently, the chemically modified lignin-derived activated carbon material (Chem-ACM) as a cathode in ZICs delivers a high capacity of 161.2 mA h g−1 at 1 A g−1 with the admirable energy density of 106.7 W h kg−1 at 897 W kg−1 and excellent retention capacity (94%) after 10,000 cycles. Mainly, the assembled quasi solid-state ZICs using Chem-ACM retains the remarkable storage capacity (202 mA h g−1 at 0.2 Ag−1) even at a high bending angle. Notably, the Chem-ACM has been further employed in symmetric supercapacitors as an electrode, and it displays exceptional specific capacitance of 354 Fg−1 at 0.5 Ag−1 with tremendous energy (43.5 W h kg−1) and the power density (0.53 kW kg−1). Additionally, the charge storage capability of Chem-ACM is positively dependent on high nitrogen contents, and it is extrapolated that pyrrolic-N moieties are dominant active sites. Hence, the designed amination-assisted biocarbon synthesis provides a new way to prepare high nitrogen-containing biocarbon for ZICs and further understand pyrrolic-N species' impact on Zn-ion storage. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.",Activated carbon; Amination; Hybrid supercapacitors; Lignin; Pyrrolic nitrogen,Activated carbon; Amines; Cathodes; Charge transfer; Chemical modification; Chemical stability; Electric discharges; Electrochemical electrodes; Energy storage; Lignin; Nitrogen oxides; Reaction kinetics; Storage (materials); Supercapacitor; Active site; Carbon material; Chemically modified; Hybrid supercapacitors; Ion storage; Modified lignins; Pyrrolic; Pyrrolic nitrogen; Storage capacity; Zn ions; Ions; activated carbon; electrolyte; graphene; lignin; nitrogen; nitrogen oxide; pyrrole derivative; zinc ion; adsorption kinetics; amination; Article; carbonization; chemical bond; chemical modification; chemical reaction kinetics; electrochemical analysis; hydrophobicity; porosity; solid state; surface area; wettability; Activated Carbon; Amines; Cathodes; Charge Transfer; Nitrogen Oxides,developing highly efficient sustainable carbon cathode essential emerging zn ion hybrid supercapacitors zics herein lignin novel chemical modification amination developed produce high quantity pyrrolic n moiety active site furthermore chemically modified amine moiety lignin vital natural self activating template generate hierarchical porosity 2d graphene like architecture exceedingly high surface area 2926 4 m2g 1 rationally introduced dominated pyrrolic n moiety boost zn ion storage capacity reaction kinetics due dual energy storage mechanism efficient charge transfer pyrrolic n zn 2 ion furthermore pyrrolic n specie energetically favorable adsorption zn 2 ion formation n zn 2 chemical bond besides nitrogen oxide reduce intrinsic resistance induce polarized surface resulting high wettability efficient transfer electrolyte pore hydrophobic carbon material subsequently chemically modified lignin derived activated carbon material chem acm cathode zics delivers high capacity 161 2 h g 1 1 g 1 admirable energy density 106 7 w h kg 1 897 w kg 1 excellent retention capacity 94 10 000 cycle mainly assembled quasi solid state zics using chem acm retains remarkable storage capacity 202 h g 1 0 2 ag 1 even high bending angle notably chem acm employed symmetric supercapacitors electrode display exceptional specific capacitance 354 fg 1 0 5 ag 1 tremendous energy 43 5 w h kg 1 power density 0 53 kw kg 1 additionally charge storage capability chem acm positively dependent high nitrogen content extrapolated pyrrolic n moiety dominant active site hence designed amination assisted biocarbon synthesis provides new way prepare high nitrogen containing biocarbon zics understand pyrrolic n specie impact zn ion storage 2023 elsevier inc,material chem acm; notably chem acm; capability chem acm; chem acm retains; chem acm employed; chem acm positively; chem acm cathode; carbon material chem; ion storage capacity; admirable energy density; moiety active site; storage capability chem; ion hybrid supercapacitors; introduced dominated pyrrolic; content extrapolated pyrrolic; charge transfer pyrrolic; acm retains remarkable; angle notably chem; acm employed symmetric; acm positively dependent,favorable adsorption zn; novel chemical modification; efficient charge transfer; energetically favorable adsorption; efficient transfer electrolyte,all rights reserved; ;Developing;Highly efficient;Sustainable;Carbon cathode;Essential;Emerging;Zn ion;Hybrid supercapacitors;ZICS;Lignin;Novel chemical modification;Amination;High quantity,0.134063877854456,0.0,0.35326210069141695

Although children start using educational apps from early age, only a few apps adhere to interaction design recommendations and undergo empirical evaluation of their educational potential. In this paper, we describe the concept and design of an app developed for promoting early math learning through finger-based multi-touch interactions in kindergarten children. Drawing from research on embodied cognition, our app provides games for fostering finger counting as well as finger-based representation of cardinal magnitude and part-whole relations. The app's efficiency was empirically evaluated through a pre-post-intervention study design with two control conditions. Results revealed that a short-term intervention with the math app did not significantly improve children's math skills when compared to learning gains of both a content-matched, unplugged math training program and a passive, waiting list control group. We discuss possible methodological reasons underlying these results, considering key curricular differences for the effectiveness of app-based interventions in early childhood education. Finally, we reflect on the appropriateness of complex multitouch interaction for young kindergarten children and suggest future directions for research in child-centered interaction design. © 2023",Early childhood education; Embodied cognition; Interaction design; Math education; Numerical development,E-learning; Design evaluation; Early age; Early childhood educations; Embodied cognition; Empirical evaluations; Interaction design; Math education; Multi-touch interactions; Numerical development; Touch-screen interaction; Application programs,ubiquity mobile device made mobile touchscreen interaction promising avenue learning although child start using educational apps early age apps adhere interaction design recommendation undergo empirical evaluation educational potential paper describe concept design app developed promoting early math learning finger based multi touch interaction kindergarten child drawing research embodied cognition app provides game fostering finger counting well finger based representation cardinal magnitude part whole relation app efficiency empirically evaluated pre post intervention study design two control condition result revealed short term intervention math app significantly improve child math skill compared learning gain content matched unplugged math training program passive waiting list control group discus possible methodological reason underlying result considering key curricular difference effectiveness app based intervention early childhood education finally reflect appropriateness complex multitouch interaction young kindergarten child suggest future direction research child centered interaction design 2023,ubiquity mobile device; recommendation undergo empirical; undergo empirical evaluation; potential paper describe; paper describe concept; representation cardinal magnitude; cardinal magnitude part; efficiency empirically evaluated; empirically evaluated pre; evaluated pre post; revealed short term; gain content matched; content matched unplugged; training program passive; program passive waiting; passive waiting list; methodological reason underlying; key curricular difference; curricular difference effectiveness; childhood education finally,improve child math; intervention math app; early math learning; math learning finger; promoting early math,Ubiquity ;Mobile device ;Touchscreen interaction ;Educational apps ;Interaction design ;Empirical evaluation ;Math learning ;Finger counting ;Cardinal magnitude ;Prepost intervention ; ,0.0564252243866066,0.2030346717332226,0.1689956199767378

Research has shown that children who enter school with relatively low math skills are unlikely to catch up to peers who begin kindergarten with more developed math skills. Emerging evidence suggests that children's executive function skills might play an important role in shaping the rate and stability of mathematical skill development during early development. Therefore in the present study, we used data from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Kindergarten Cohort 2010-11—a prospective sample of over 18,000 children in the United States—to examine executive function as an antecedent to characteristics of growth in math skills and to test whether executive function moderates the longitudinal stability of math achievement from kindergarten through second grade. Latent growth curve models reveal that executive function is related to not only the level of math skills at school entry but also to the rate of growth in early elementary years. Moreover, we found that executive function moderated the stability of math achievement from kindergarten to second grade, suggesting that early executive function skills can serve as a compensatory mechanism for children who enter school with lower levels of mathematical skills. These findings might have important implications for narrowing gaps in math achievement during early elementary school. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.",Early childhood; Early elementary grades; Executive function; Latent growth curve models; Math achievement,achievement; article; child; childhood; cohort analysis; executive function; female; growth curve; growth rate; human; infant; kindergarten; longitudinal study; male; primary school; skill; United States,substantial rank order stability child mathematical skill throughout development research shown child enter school relatively low math skill unlikely catch peer begin kindergarten developed math skill emerging evidence suggests child executive function skill might play important role shaping rate stability mathematical skill development early development therefore present study used data early childhood longitudinal study kindergarten cohort 2010 11 prospective sample 18 000 child united state examine executive function antecedent characteristic growth math skill test whether executive function moderate longitudinal stability math achievement kindergarten second grade latent growth curve model reveal executive function related level math skill school entry also rate growth early elementary year moreover found executive function moderated stability math achievement kindergarten second grade suggesting early executive function skill serve compensatory mechanism child enter school lower level mathematical skill finding might important implication narrowing gap math achievement early elementary school 2023 elsevier inc,math achievement kindergarten; stability math achievement; executive function skill; child enter school; substantial rank order; gap math achievement; examine executive function; executive function antecedent; executive function moderate; reveal executive function; executive function related; found executive function; function antecedent characteristic; function moderate longitudinal; function related level; state examine executive; model reveal executive; catch peer begin; emerging evidence suggests; united state examine,math achievement kindergarten; kindergarten developed math; math skill school; math skill test; gap math achievement,; Substantial; Rank Order Stability; Child; Mathematical Skill; Development; Research; Executive Function Skill; Math Achievement; Kindergarten; Second Grade; Early Childhood Longitudinal Study; United States; Latent Growth Curve Model; Early Elementary Year; Compensatory,0.3208472313153022,0.1721056534777183,0.5169782898017927

The present study examines the effects of the Playful Learning Curriculum in ECEC on children's school readiness skills in the play-based ECEC context of Norway. A total of 96 ECEC centers signed up for the project and recruited 1,313 children. Centers were randomly assigned to an intervention (n = 49) and a control group (n = 47). Intervention centers were asked to implement the curriculum for at least eight hours per week for nine months, and control centers continued as usual. Outcomes included the Ani Banani Math Test (ABMT), the Preschool Early Numeracy Skills Screener (PENS), the Norwegian Vocabulary Test (NVT), and the Weschler's Intelligence Digit Span Test (DS). Analyses clustered by centers and controlling for blocks showed a significant effect of the intervention on children's mathematics skills, ABMT (d =.079, p =.03) and PENS (d =.104, p =.01), but no significant effects on working memory assessed by DS (d =.070, p =.14) or expressive vocabulary assessed by NVT (d = -.011, p = .65).

Math anxiety is a negative emotional response that is characterized by avoidance and feelings of stress and anxiety in situations involving mathematical reasoning. Math anxiety in students has been suggested to dampening learning and mastering of mathematics. Among various math skills, the ability to do conceptual knowledge of math has been confirmed to be significantly and negatively correlated with math anxiety. As an essential type of knowledge in mathematics, conceptual understanding is defined as an implicit or explicit understanding of the principles that govern a domain and of the relationships between units of knowledge in a domain. Neuroimaging studies have shown that the regions of the brain needed for processing mathematical conceptual knowledge might differ from those needed for other types of math such as calculation or basic numerical processing. Doing conceptual knowledge of math reportedly activated brain regions that are related to numerical processing, such as the bilateral intraparietal sulcus (IPS), as well as brain regions associated with general conceptual knowledge processing, such as the left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and left middle temporal gyrus (MTG). Although the correlation between conceptual math skill and math anxiety has been confirmed at the behavioral level, the neural mechanism remains unknown. Previous studies found that in people with high math anxiety, brain regions related to negative emotions were found to be more active during the numerical tasks, while regions related to emotion regulation and the processing of numbers and calculations were less active. In addition to hyper-activation of the emotional network, brain regions that govern mathematical tasks, showed reduced activation in people with high math anxiety. To address the neural mechanism that allows math anxiety to impede the processing of conceptual math, we used resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to determine how brain activity is related to the effects that math anxiety has on the performance of problems that test conceptual math knowledge. (1) we selected four regions of interest (ROIs) that were considered as important neural substrates for processing arithmetic principles in a previous fMRI study. We performed correlation analysis between the seed-based FC maps and the performance of math conceptual knowledge to construct neural pathways that process math conceptual knowledge. (2) we utilized mediation analysis to investigate the relationships between math anxiety, the performance of math conceptual knowledge, and the possible neural pathways. To avoid numerical formats that would likely induce confounding math anxiety, we used a verbalized arithmetic principles task. After excluding trait anxiety and state anxiety abnormalities, as well as participants who exceed the criterion of head motion during scanning, 92 healthy adult university students (43 females), aged 18-23 years (M = 20.91, SD = 2.33) were left for the data analysis. After controlling for the extraneous factors such as language and intelligence, the partial correlation results showed a significant negative correlation between mathematical anxiety and performance on conceptual knowledge of mathematics (r = −0.26, p = 0.008), which replicated the findings of previous studies and confirmed that mathematical anxiety did inhibit individuals' learning and acquisition of conceptual knowledge of mathematics. The functional connectivity in the resting brain of individuals was correlated with different levels of mathematical anxiety in the functional connectivity between the horizontal segment of the right intraparietal sulcus and the right insula. Furthermore, this functional connectivity fully mediated the correlation between the level of mathematical anxiety and the performance of mathematical conceptual knowledge. These results suggest that the interaction between mathematical/computation-related brain regions (e.g. the horizontal segment of the intraparietal sulcus) and anxiety circuits (e.g. the insula) may be the neural basis for the negative effect of mathematical anxiety on the performance of mathematical conceptual knowledge. © 2023, Science Press.

Here, based on density functional theory calculation, the epitaxial growth of BA monolayer was simulated. GeS(001) is found to be a suitable substrate for BA monolayer to epitaxially grow on. As a common isomer of arsenene, gray arsenene should be considered during the growth, because it is also energetically and thermodynamically stable in freestanding state. However, black arsenene monolayer is more energetically and thermodynamically stable than gray arsenene monolayer on GeS(001) substrate. During the growth, two arsenene atoms easily form a dimer on GeS(001), which diffuses more quickly and isotropically than arsenene monomer. In addition, the heterojunction consisted of balck arsenene and GeS(001) is an indirect gap semiconductor, but it can transform into a direct gap semiconductor with external tensile strain along zigzag direction. Remarkably, optical adsorption spectra range of BA/GeS(001) can be more abroad than that of BA and GeS(001) bilayers.

The analysis of the measured data presents the main meteorological factors affecting the thermal comfort of the courtyard. The magnitude of the effects is ranked as air temperature, total solar radiation intensity, near-surface air flow rate, and relative humidity. Results of the ENVI-met simulation show that changing the cover of different underlying surface types leads to different microclimate regulation effects in the sense that the temperature and relative humidity in summer drops up to 3.53 °C and 15.59%, respectively and in winter increase up to 3.97 °C and 37.21%, respectively.

Using a regional climate-chemistry-ecology model RegCM-Chem-YIBs, we investigated the synergetic impacts of aerosol radiative effect (ARE) and atmospheric quasi-biweekly oscillation (QBWO) on a PHP event in December 2013. The event consists of two peak stages and a persistence stage between them. Process analysis shows that chemical reactions and advection are the most important processes in the accumulation of PM2.5. Chemical reactions contribute 30–40 μg m−3 hr−1 to the rapid development of PHP, which is far more than that in clean days. Through sensitivity experiments, the influences of ARE and QBWO on PM2.5 variation via changing meteorological conditions were quantified respectively. During the event, ARE leads to a reduction of 24.0% in solar radiation and −33.8% in surface air temperature. The planetary boundary layer height is lowered by 20.8%. The feedback of ARE to PM2.5 ranges from 20 to 170 μg m−3, with the largest changes at PM2.5 peak stages. In comparison, QBWO exerts dominant influence at the persistence stage, during which the East Asia trough and northerlies are weakened constantly. Besides, QBWO causes a decrease of −39.5% in wind speed and an increase of 14.3% in relative humidity near the surface. The rates of chemical process and advection are increased considerably at the first peak stage and the persistence stage. QBWO also slows down the dissipation of PHP, prolonging the pollution duration. Finally, a range of 60–110 μg m−3 increase in PM2.5 is attributed to QBWO. In all, ARE and QBWO take different roles in the formation of PHP. ARE mainly affects the pollution intensity by accelerating chemical reactions, while QBWO determines the persistence of heavy pollution by changing both advection and chemical processes. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",Aerosol radiative effect; Atmospheric quasi-biweekly oscillation; Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region; Persistent heavy PM2.5 pollution,,persistent heavy pm2 5 pollution php occurs frequently beijing tianjin hebei bth region winter formation mechanism fully understood using regional climate chemistry ecology model regcm chem yib investigated synergetic impact aerosol radiative effect atmospheric quasi biweekly oscillation qbwo php event december 2013 event consists two peak stage persistence stage process analysis show chemical reaction advection important process accumulation pm2 5 chemical reaction contribute 30 40 μg 3 hr 1 rapid development php far clean day sensitivity experiment influence qbwo pm2 5 variation via changing meteorological condition quantified respectively event lead reduction 24 0 solar radiation 33 8 surface air temperature planetary boundary layer height lowered 20 8 feedback pm2 5 range 20 170 μg 3 largest change pm2 5 peak stage comparison qbwo exerts dominant influence persistence stage east asia trough northerly weakened constantly besides qbwo cause decrease 39 5 wind speed increase 14 3 relative humidity near surface rate chemical process advection increased considerably first peak stage persistence stage qbwo also slows dissipation php prolonging pollution duration finally range 60 110 μg 3 increase pm2 5 attributed qbwo qbwo take different role formation php mainly affect pollution intensity accelerating chemical reaction qbwo determines persistence heavy pollution changing advection chemical process 2023 elsevier ltd,peak stage persistence; stage persistence stage; wind speed increase; duration finally range; chemical reaction contribute; layer height lowered; persistence stage east; peak stage comparison; stage east asia; influence persistence stage; show chemical reaction; accelerating chemical reaction; important process accumulation; occurs frequently beijing; frequently beijing tianjin; beijing tianjin hebei; tianjin hebei bth; hebei bth region; bth region winter; mechanism fully understood,climate chemistry ecology; regional climate chemistry; climate chemistry; frequently beijing tianjin; chemistry ecology model,Persistent Heavy PM2.5 Pollution ;Beijing Tianjin Hebei BTH Region ;Winter Formation Mechanism ;Regional Climate Chemistry Ecology Model ;Synergetic Impact Aerosol Radiative Effect ;Atmospheric Quasi Bi,0.2254492686713903,0.088346515256358,0.6428964566639629

It contributes significantly to the dynamics of global CO2 distributions and variances. Quantifying the impacts of biomass burning emissions on atmospheric CO2 concentrations is essential for global and regional carbon cycles and budgets. In this study, we performed several numerical experiments by switching and replacing inventories to estimate the impacts of four biomass burning emission inventories on atmospheric CO2 concentration simulations in 2006–2010 based on the global chemical transport model, GEOS-Chem. The results highlighted similarities and differences in the annual and seasonal variability of biomass burning emissions and simulated CO2 concentrations at global and regional scales. Based on four different biomass burning emission inventories, we found that biomass burning emissions could lead to a global CO2 concentration increase of 2.4 ppm annually. Africa contributed the largest global CO2 emissions among all continental regions, where the maximum CO2 concentration increase could reach 7.9–13.0 ppm in summer. Model evaluation results showed that simulation using the Quick Fire Emissions Database (QFED) as the model priori biomass burning emission inventory had the best performance compared with the satellite and surface observations. The sensitivity of simulated CO2 concentrations to the uncertainties in different biomass burning emission inventories was high in southern South America and most areas of the Eurasian continent, and low in central Africa and Southeast Asia. This study furthers our understanding of the critical role of biomass burning in atmospheric CO2 and indicates an urgent need to improve the accuracy of biomass burning emission estimates in CO2 simulations. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.",Biomass burning emission; CO2 concentrations; Inventory switching and replacing; Model simulations; Spatiotemporal characteristics,Atmospheric chemistry; Atmospheric movements; Biomass; Budget control; Atmospheric CO 2; Biomass burning emissions; Biomass-burning; Carbon cycles; CO 2 concentration; Emission inventories; Inventory switching and replacing; Modeling simulation; Spatiotemporal characteristics; Spatiotemporal variability; Carbon dioxide; atmospheric chemistry; biomass burning; carbon dioxide; concentration (composition); database; emission inventory; EOS; spatiotemporal analysis; Article; atmospheric transport; biomass burning emission; biomass production; carbon dioxide emission; carbon source; Central Africa; computer simulation; seasonal variation; South America; Southeast Asia,biomass burning substantial spatiotemporal variability contributes significantly dynamic global co2 distribution variance quantifying impact biomass burning emission atmospheric co2 concentration essential global regional carbon cycle budget study performed several numerical experiment switching replacing inventory estimate impact four biomass burning emission inventory atmospheric co2 concentration simulation 2006 2010 based global chemical transport model geos chem result highlighted similarity difference annual seasonal variability biomass burning emission simulated co2 concentration global regional scale based four different biomass burning emission inventory found biomass burning emission could lead global co2 concentration increase 2 4 ppm annually africa contributed largest global co2 emission among continental region maximum co2 concentration increase could reach 7 9 13 0 ppm summer model evaluation result showed simulation using quick fire emission database qfed model priori biomass burning emission inventory best performance compared satellite surface observation sensitivity simulated co2 concentration uncertainty different biomass burning emission inventory high southern south america area eurasian continent low central africa southeast asia study furthers understanding critical role biomass burning atmospheric co2 indicates urgent need improve accuracy biomass burning emission estimate co2 simulation 2023 elsevier b v,biomass burning emission; burning emission inventory; burning emission atmospheric; burning emission simulated; biomass burning atmospheric; biomass burning substantial; found biomass burning; priori biomass burning; role biomass burning; accuracy biomass burning; biomass burning; burning emission estimate; burning substantial spatiotemporal; impact biomass burning; variability biomass burning; burning emission; emission inventory atmospheric; observation sensitivity simulated; distribution variance quantifying; continental region maximum,biomass burning substantial; co2 concentration increase; accuracy biomass burning; increase ppm annually; variability biomass burning,Biomass Burning ;Spatiotemporal Variability ;Global CO2 Distribution ;Variance Quantifying ;Impact Biomass Burning ;Emission Atmospheric CO2 ;Concentration Essential ;Global Regional Carbon,0.4777654191141576,0.357153885285002,0.4379402894214868

In this study, we use the observation and WRF-Chem (Weather Research and Forecasting Model with Chemistry) simulation to analyze the factors affecting the removal efficiency in a continuous fog and haze episode from November 26 to 28, 2018 in Jiangsu Province, such as fog thickness and duration. The results show that the WRF-Chem simulation well reproduces the boundary layer characteristics in the stages of fog formation, development and dissipation. The atmospheric boundary layer provides favorable conditions for the maintenance of fog and air pollution. The inversion layer, with the maximum intensity of 3 °C per 100 m, creates favorable thermal conditions, and the water vapor advection is also conducive to the fog maintenance. The ground observation verifies the wet scavenging of PM2.5 during dense fog events. The scavenging effect is related to the fog duration, and the correlation is positive when the fog is just formed and negative when the fog is dissipating. The PM2.5 concentration decreases from 159 μg m−3 to 38 μg m−3 after the fog lasts for 11 h. The fog has a remarkable scavenging effect on PM2.5 in the vertical direction, due to the deposition effect of fog droplets on the pollutant particles. The PM2.5 concentration on the ground is lower than the vertical average in the fog area, and the scavenging effects during the dense fog periods on November 27 and 28 are 47.7 μg m−3 and 36.1 μg m−3, respectively. The fog duration is mostly concentrated in 3–17 h. When the duration of fog is 4–8 h, the scavenging effect on PM2.5 reaches the strongest, with an average PM2.5 concentration decrease of &gt;70 μg m−3. © 2023",Air pollution; Fog; Model simulation; Wet scavenging; WRF-Chem,Air pollution; Atmospheric chemistry; Fog; Particles (particulate matter); River pollution; Chemistry simulations; Dense fog; Modeling simulation; Particulate Matter; PM 2.5; Scavenging effect; Weather research and forecasting model with chemistry; Weather research and forecasting models; Wet scavenging; Yangtze river delta; Weather forecasting; advection; atmospheric pollution; boundary layer; dissipation; fog; observational method; particulate matter; scavenging (chemistry); simulation; water vapor; advection; air pollution; article; boundary layer; China; haze; particulate matter; particulate matter 2.5; predictive model; river; simulation; thickness; water vapor; weather; China; Yangtze River,stable atmospheric boundary layer conducive accumulation atmospheric pollution occurrence fog fog removal effect air pollution study use observation wrf chem weather research forecasting model chemistry simulation analyze factor affecting removal efficiency continuous fog haze episode november 26 28 2018 jiangsu province fog thickness duration result show wrf chem simulation well reproduces boundary layer characteristic stage fog formation development dissipation atmospheric boundary layer provides favorable condition maintenance fog air pollution inversion layer maximum intensity 3 c per 100 creates favorable thermal condition water vapor advection also conducive fog maintenance ground observation verifies wet scavenging pm2 5 dense fog event scavenging effect related fog duration correlation positive fog formed negative fog dissipating pm2 5 concentration decrease 159 μg 3 38 μg 3 fog last 11 h fog remarkable scavenging effect pm2 5 vertical direction due deposition effect fog droplet pollutant particle pm2 5 concentration ground lower vertical average fog area scavenging effect dense fog period november 27 28 47 7 μg 3 36 1 μg 3 respectively fog duration mostly concentrated 3 17 h duration fog 4 8 h scavenging effect pm2 5 reach strongest average pm2 5 concentration decrease gt 70 μg 3 2023,atmospheric boundary layer; scavenging effect dense; stable atmospheric boundary; boundary layer conducive; reproduces boundary layer; boundary layer characteristic; concentration ground lower; scavenging effect related; event scavenging effect; remarkable scavenging effect; area scavenging effect; dissipation atmospheric boundary; effect air pollution; layer maximum intensity; verifies wet scavenging; removal effect air; pollution inversion layer; haze episode november; observation wrf chem; wrf chem simulation,fog fog removal; conducive fog maintenance; chem weather research; fog duration correlation; fog formation development,stable atmospheric boundary layer ;conducive accumulation ;atmospheric pollution ;occurrence fog ;fog removal effect ;air pollution study ;use observation ;WRFChem ;weather research forecasting model ;chemistry simulation,0.3981565696506718,0.3491703227831751,0.3902064239383626

Communities and parents were provided with information about student learning together with school grants. They also participated in discussions about how communities and schools can work together utilizing the grants and communities’ own resources. After the intervention, the communities increased activities that enhanced student effort, and parents increased their contribution to school activities and engagement in children's learning at home.

However, as motion and noise artifacts continue to pose manifold challenges toward the task of remote estimation of this signal (popularly known as rPPG), an authentic approximation of rPPG signals is of immense interest and convenience. In this work, we present a self-supervised learning-based regression framework that can reliably estimate the heart rate by accurately approximating a PPG signal from a participant's videos with sufficient coverage of their skin regions, in the presence of different types of local noises. The idea is that the PPG signals generated from the different parts of an individual will be nearly identical, while these signals from two different individuals may be comparably different. Though the severity of difference may vary based on the variance in their health conditions. Motivated by this intuition, we augment an rPPG signal extracted from a given facial landmark of an individual, using various other rPPG signals extracted from the neighboring facial landmarks of the same individual, to align their unique personalized patterns. Specifically, we develop a robust Similarity-aware PPG (SimPPG) based heart-rate estimation scheme that adopts the instance discrimination method within a self-supervised learning setting to perform two-fold objectives: (1) discriminating every positive pair (rPPGs from different local skin regions of a given individual) from all negative pairs (rPPGs from different local skin regions of different individuals in a batch); (2) enforcing the alignments in the individual's respective heart-rate predictions with that of the corresponding ground truth PPG signals in parallel. Experiments using the large-scale UBFC-Phys dataset and our in-house data collection not only show a remarkable performance of SimPPG (MAEhr=1.89bpm, which is 77% improvement compared to the existing baseline and MSE=2.91 in approximating the PPG signal), but also show its effectiveness in terms of handling various skin features across demographics. In a limited data environment, SimPPG is reported to have used only a random 75% of the available training collection to attain a competitive performance compared to several state-of-the-art models. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.",Evaluation; Heart-rate estimation; Instance discrimination; Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) approximation; Self-supervised learning,adult; article; case report; clinical article; demographics; face; female; heart rate; human; human experiment; intuition; learning; male; noise; photoelectric plethysmography; prediction; skin; videorecording,photoplethysmography ppg optical measurement technique detect blood volume change microvascular bed target tissue widely used technique adopted wearable device evaluate individual health condition however motion noise artifact continue pose manifold challenge toward task remote estimation signal popularly known rppg authentic approximation rppg signal immense interest convenience work present self supervised learning based regression framework reliably estimate heart rate accurately approximating ppg signal participant video sufficient coverage skin region presence different type local noise idea ppg signal generated different part individual nearly identical signal two different individual may comparably different though severity difference may vary based variance health condition motivated intuition augment rppg signal extracted given facial landmark individual using various rppg signal extracted neighboring facial landmark individual align unique personalized pattern specifically develop robust similarity aware ppg simppg based heart rate estimation scheme adopts instance discrimination method within self supervised learning setting perform two fold objective 1 discriminating every positive pair rppgs different local skin region given individual negative pair rppgs different local skin region different individual batch 2 enforcing alignment individual respective heart rate prediction corresponding ground truth ppg signal parallel experiment using large scale ubfc phys dataset house data collection show remarkable performance simppg maehr 1 89bpm 77 improvement compared existing baseline mse 2 91 approximating ppg signal also show effectiveness term handling various skin feature across demographic limited data environment simppg reported used random 75 available training collection attain competitive performance compared several state art model 2023 elsevier inc,local skin region; approximating ppg signal; rppg signal extracted; facial landmark individual; neighboring facial landmark; supervised learning setting; coverage skin region; skin region presence; estimate heart rate; heart rate accurately; respective heart rate; heart rate prediction; photoplethysmography ppg optical; existing baseline mse; state art model; rate accurately approximating; supervised learning based; health condition motivated; variance health condition; extracted neighboring facial,technique detect blood; detect blood volume; photoplethysmography ppg optical; reliably estimate heart; blood volume change,Photoplethysmography (PPG) ;Optical measurement technique ;Detect blood volume change ;Microvascular bed ;Target tissue ;Widely used technique ;Adopted wearable device ;Evaluate individual health condition,0.3351407653787105,0.107144095250855,0.058186761117181

In this context, we examine how the early foundational skills (i.e., reading and math scores) is differently associated with the education continuation of SC/ST (i.e., Scheduled Castes/Tribes) and non-SC/ST children, and its variation by gender and location. Using India Human Development Survey panel (2005 & 2011–12) data, we find that children from disadvantaged groups (such as SCs and STs) have significantly lesser chances of education continuation, post enrolment. The level of early reading and math scores are positively and significantly associated with the likelihood of students’ education continuation. In addition, using the interaction analysis, we find that the marginal effect of reading and math scores is significantly higher for SC/ST female and urban children than their non-SC/ST counterparts.

Meanwhile, the western United States, particularly the coastal areas from Washington to California, received much less precipitation than normal during early 2020. Is it possible that this reduction in precipitation was driven by the reduced aerosols due to the coronavirus? Here we show that the reduction in aerosols resulted in higher temperatures (up to ∼0.5 °C) and generally lower snow amounts but cannot explain the observed low precipitation amounts over this region. In addition to an assessment of the effects of the coronavirus-related reduction in aerosols on precipitation across the western United States, our findings also provide basic information on the potential impacts different mitigation efforts aimed at reducing anthropogenic aerosols would have on the regional climate. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.",Aerosols; COVID-19; Precipitation; Temperature; Western United States; WRF-Chem,Aerosols; Air quality; % reductions; California; Coastal area; Condition; Coronaviruses; Highest temperature; Potential impacts; Washington; Western United States; WRF/Chem; COVID-19,among many impact covid 19 pandemic led improved air quality condition country quarantine due shutdown industry drastically reduced traffic lockdown meanwhile western united state particularly coastal area washington california received much le precipitation normal early 2020 possible reduction precipitation driven reduced aerosol due coronavirus show reduction aerosol resulted higher temperature 0 5 c generally lower snow amount cannot explain observed low precipitation amount region addition assessment effect coronavirus related reduction aerosol precipitation across western united state finding also provide basic information potential impact different mitigation effort aimed reducing anthropogenic aerosol would regional climate 2023 elsevier b v,western united state; resulted higher temperature; pandemic led improved; united state finding; led improved air; improved air quality; air quality condition; quality condition country; condition country quarantine; shutdown industry drastically; coastal area washington; area washington california; washington california received; generally lower snow; explain observed low; region addition assessment; addition assessment effect; provide basic information; basic information potential; mitigation effort aimed,reduced traffic lockdown; reduced aerosol coronavirus; coronavirus reduction aerosol; aerosol coronavirus reduction; coronavirus reduction,Covid 19;Pandemic;Air Quality;Quarantine;Shutdown;Traffic;Lockdown;Western United States;Coastal Area;Washington;California;Precipitation;Aerosol;Temperature;Snow,0.1063461796417011,0.0,0.4645211194168555

Combining the CRE visit records with administrative student data, I find that CRE leads to 0.02–0.03 of a standard deviation increase in statewide English Language Arts test scores among low-income students one year after the visit and find suggestive evidence that CRE improves the math scores for subgroups of students in poverty. In particular, the CRE effect varies based on locality and access to reading materials, with a larger effect on students residing in metropolitan areas or close to public libraries.

Background: Allophylus africanus P. Beauv is a medicinal plant commonly used in sub-Sahara Africa for the treatment of metabolic disorders and infectious diseases. Objective: The objective of the study was to isolate and characterize anti-hyperglycemic and anti-hyperlipidemic chemical constituents from Allophylus africanus, and to investigate the mechanism of their enzymatic inhibitions. Methods: The chemical constituents were isolated using various column chromatographic tech-niques. The anti-hyperlipidemic and anti-hyperglycemic properties of the chemical constituents were investigated by measuring their inhibitory effects on porcine pancreatic lipase and α-glucosidase enzymes. Fluorescence quenching constants obtained from Stern−Volmer plots were used to determine the mechanisms of inhibitory action. Results: Twelve compounds, of which three were new peptide alkaloids, ethylamino asperphena-mate (10), allophylane (11) and allophyline (12), were isolated. The new peptide alkaloids and asperphenamate (9) inhibited porcine pancreatic lipase in a dose-dependent manner with IC50 &lt; 90 µM. Also, 9, 12, stigmasta-5, 22-dien-3-O-β-D-glucoside (3) and eudesmenol (5) inhibited α-glucosidase enzymes with IC50 &lt; 165 µM, which was lower than that of standard drug, acarbose (432.16 ± 6.52 µM). From the Stern-Volmer plots, 9 and 10 indicated a static quenching, while 11 and 12 suggested the occurrence of both static and dynamic quenching mechanisms on porcine pancreatic lipase. On α-glucosidase, only 12 exhibited a concurrent static and dynamic quenching mechanism. Conclusion: The anti-diabesity compounds obtained from A. africanus established its potential for the treatment of metabolic disorders.

However, their applications in some specific fields, such as chem-/biosensing remain hampered due to their inherent instability to different external stimuli. Herein, we discover a novel mechanism that ethanol, a chemical that is generally thought to be detrimental to PNCs, could specifically initiate the in-situ crystallization of the precursor salts absorbed by paper fiber to yield standard CsPbBr3 fluorescent PNCs. Based on systematical experimental verification, it is revealed that ethanol could mediate the interfacial interaction of the PNC precursor salts on the paper fiber to allow for this exceptional in-situ PNC crystallization process. Accordingly, a fluorescence turn-on mode paper sensor for rapid and high-sensitive expiratory alcohol detection is designed, which could fulfill the on-site visualized drink-driving screening requirement. Furthermore, the application of this new mechanism in multidimensional information encryption is also demonstrated. This work not only discovers a new mechanism for PNC crystallization but also expands the sensing application toolbox of PNCs. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.",Ethanol-induced crystallization; Expiratory alcohol screening; Information encryption; Paper sensor; Perovskite nanocrystals,Bromine compounds; Cryptography; Ethanol; Fluorescence; Lead compounds; Perovskite; Salts; Crystallization mechanisms; Ethanol-induced crystallization; Expiratory alcohol screening; Induced crystallization; Information encryption; New mechanisms; Paper fibres; Paper sensor; Perovskite nanocrystal; Precursor salts; Nanocrystals,perovskite nanocrystals pncs promising fluorescent nanomaterials employed wide range area however application specific field chem biosensing remain hampered due inherent instability different external stimulus herein discover novel mechanism ethanol chemical generally thought detrimental pncs could specifically initiate situ crystallization precursor salt absorbed paper fiber yield standard cspbbr3 fluorescent pncs based systematical experimental verification revealed ethanol could mediate interfacial interaction pnc precursor salt paper fiber allow exceptional situ pnc crystallization process accordingly fluorescence turn mode paper sensor rapid high sensitive expiratory alcohol detection designed could fulfill site visualized drink driving screening requirement furthermore application new mechanism multidimensional information encryption also demonstrated work discovers new mechanism pnc crystallization also expands sensing application toolbox pncs 2023 elsevier b v,fiber yield standard; precursor salt absorbed; crystallization precursor salt; precursor salt paper; salt paper fiber; nanomaterials employed wide; employed wide range; wide range area; specific field chem; field chem biosensing; chem biosensing remain; biosensing remain hampered; remain hampered due; hampered due inherent; due inherent instability; chemical generally thought; generally thought detrimental; based systematical experimental; systematical experimental verification; experimental verification revealed,promising fluorescent nanomaterials; fluorescent nanomaterials employed; fluorescent nanomaterials; cspbbr3 fluorescent pncs; pncs promising fluorescent,Perovskite nanocrystals (PNCs) ;Fluorescent nanomaterials ;Ethanol ;Precursor salt ;Paper fiber ;CSPBBR3 ;Fluorescence ;Multidimensional information,0.04541943369071,0.0,0.3240517695167553

When the probe interacts with the sample, the light is diffracted and a diffraction pattern is detected. Then the sample (or probe) is shifted laterally in space to illuminate a new area of the sample whilst ensuring sufficient overlap. Similarly, in Fourier ptychography a sample is illuminated at different angles of incidence (effectively shifting the sample’s Fourier transform) after which a lens acts as a low-pass filter, thereby effectively providing localized Fourier information about the sample around frequencies dictated by each angle of illumination. Mathematically, one therefore obtains a similar set of overlapping measurements of the sample in both Fourier ptychography and ptychography, except in the different domains (Fourier for the former, and physical for the latter). In either case, one is then able to reconstruct an image of the sample from the measurements using similar methods. Near-Field (Fourier) Ptychography (NFP) (see, e.g., Stockmar et al. (Sci Rep 3(1):1–6, 2013), Stockmar et al. (Phys Rev Appl 3(1): 014005, 2015) and Zhang et al. (Optics Exp 27(5): 7498–7512, 2019)) occurs when the sample is placed at a short defocus distance having a large Fresnel number. In this paper, we prove that certain NFP measurements are robustly invertible (up to an unavoidable global phase ambiguity) for specific Point Spread Functions (PSFs) and physical masks which lead to well-conditioned lifted linear systems. We then apply a block phase retrieval algorithm using weighted angular synchronization and prove that the proposed approach accurately recovers the measured sample for these specific PSF and mask pairs. Finally, we also propose using a Wirtinger Flow for NFP problems and numerically evaluate that alternate approach both against our main proposed approach, as well as with NFP measurements for which our main approach does not apply. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Fourier ptychography; Inverse problems; Near-field ptychography; Phase retrieval; Weighted angular synchronization; Wirtinger flow,,ptychography imaging technique involves sample illuminated coherent localized probe illumination probe interacts sample light diffracted diffraction pattern detected sample probe shifted laterally space illuminate new area sample whilst ensuring sufficient overlap similarly fourier ptychography sample illuminated different angle incidence effectively shifting sample fourier transform lens act low pas filter thereby effectively providing localized fourier information sample around frequency dictated angle illumination mathematically one therefore obtains similar set overlapping measurement sample fourier ptychography ptychography except different domain fourier former physical latter either case one able reconstruct image sample measurement using similar method near field fourier ptychography nfp see e g stockmar et al sci rep 3 1 1 6 2013 stockmar et al phys rev appl 3 1 014005 2015 zhang et al optic exp 27 5 7498 7512 2019 occurs sample placed short defocus distance large fresnel number paper prove certain nfp measurement robustly invertible unavoidable global phase ambiguity specific point spread function psf physical mask lead well conditioned lifted linear system apply block phase retrieval algorithm using weighted angular synchronization prove proposed approach accurately recovers measured sample specific psf mask pair finally also propose using wirtinger flow nfp problem numerically evaluate alternate approach main proposed approach well nfp measurement main approach apply 2023 author exclusive licence springer nature switzerland ag,author exclusive licence; phys rev appl; fourier ptychography ptychography; similarly fourier ptychography; field fourier ptychography; proposed approach accurately; illuminated coherent localized; synchronization prove proposed; ptychography imaging technique; fourier ptychography nfp; prove proposed approach; approach main proposed; main proposed approach; fourier transform lens; overlap similarly fourier; imaging technique involves; light diffracted diffraction; diffracted diffraction pattern; diffraction pattern detected; shifted laterally space,sample fourier ptychography; fourier ptychography sample; ptychography sample illuminated; fourier transform lens; field fourier ptychography,Ptychography;Imaging technique;Coherent localized probe illumination;Diffracted diffraction pattern;Shifted laterally;Fourier Ptychography;Different angle of incidence;Fourier transform;Low pass filter;Near field Fou,0.387202559592326,0.4538914500401311,0.3296043998759183

Identifying the relative importance of those factors could facilitate designing urban fabric and roadside vegetation combination patterns to mitigate the negative impacts of particles. This study first proposes an effective and reliable integrated method of the ENVI-met microclimate model and interpretable machine learning to quantify the multifactorial effects. Data from ENVI-met models with different built environments and meteorological conditions are used to train and test the machine learning (ML) models. All ML models show high accuracy in predicting PM2.5 concentrations with R2 high than 0.87. Results indicate that height level and study area are the two most important features, explaining 22.8% and 20.4% of the variation in PM2.5 concentration, respectively. The feature pairwise interactions account for 45.8% of ambient particle concentrations. The combination of trees and hedges in urban fabrics with longer building length than width could mitigate PM2.5 concentrations in residential areas.

Quantitative data on changes in hunting skills in indigenous communities driven by education, employment, and other lifestyle changes are lacking. Here we assess hunting skills of young people in Papua New Guinea (PNG). We use a sample of 7818 secondary school students, representing 15% of the most educated individuals in their age cohort. Students self-assessed their hunting skills as none (34% of respondents), poor (46%), and good (20%). Male students reported significantly higher hunting skills than female students. Hunting skills were positively correlated with knowledge of local bird species and with other traditional skills (growing food, using medicinal plants, building houses). They were negatively correlated with math and English skills, as well as with the transportation accessibility of the village/town where the students grew up. Students who grow up in town reported significantly lower hunting skills than those who grew up in village. These results show that students' hunting skills are already low, and the trends in their socio-cultural drivers predict a further decline in the future. The increasing disconnection from the natural environment and the declining attractiveness of hunting as prestigious activity for the young and educated people are part of a broader trend of loss of ethnobiological knowledge in PNG's indigenous communities. While it may reduce hunting pressure on some endangered species, it may also remove traditional incentives for conservation in rainforest-dwelling communities. © 2023 The Authors",Biodiversity conservation; Education; Ethnobiological knowledge; Hunting skills; Indigenous communities; Tropical forests,,hunting component traditional indigenous livelihood play either positive negative role biodiversity conservation maintaining traditional lifestyle conducive conservation endangering vulnerable hunted specie quantitative data change hunting skill indigenous community driven education employment lifestyle change lacking ass hunting skill young people papua new guinea png use sample 7818 secondary school student representing 15 educated individual age cohort student self assessed hunting skill none 34 respondent poor 46 good 20 male student reported significantly higher hunting skill female student hunting skill positively correlated knowledge local bird specie traditional skill growing food using medicinal plant building house negatively correlated math english skill well transportation accessibility village town student grew student grow town reported significantly lower hunting skill grew village result show student hunting skill already low trend socio cultural driver predict decline future increasing disconnection natural environment declining attractiveness hunting prestigious activity young educated people part broader trend loss ethnobiological knowledge png indigenous community may reduce hunting pressure endangered specie may also remove traditional incentive conservation rainforest dwelling community 2023 author,student hunting skill; reported significantly higher; reported significantly lower; town reported significantly; positive negative role; negative role biodiversity; endangering vulnerable hunted; driven education employment; individual age cohort; medicinal plant building; plant building house; building house negatively; socio cultural driver; cultural driver predict; driver predict decline; predict decline future; decline future increasing; future increasing disconnection; increasing disconnection natural; disconnection natural environment,hunting pressure endangered; student hunting skill; hunting skill indigenous; female student hunting; endangering vulnerable hunted,hunting; component; traditional; indigenous; livelihood; positive; negative; biodiversity; conservation; maintaining; lifestyle; conducive; endangering; vulnerable; hunted; specie; quantitative; data; change; skill; community; driven; education; employment; lifestyle change; lacking;,0.0692645158565561,0.2767976827359426,0.2482324586017075

We implemented high performance data packet reception based on data plane development kit (DPDK) and high-throughput data storing using both hierarchical data format version 5 (HDF5) as well as the adaptable input/output system version 2 (ADIOS2). Furthermore, we extended RISA's underlying pipelining framework to support the fork-join paradigm. This allows for more complex workflows as it is necessary, e.g. for online data processing. Also, the pipeline configuration is moved from compile-time to runtime, i.e. processing stages and their interconnections can now be configured using a configuration file. In several benchmarks, RISA is profiled regarding data acquisition performance, data storage throughput and overall processing latency. We found that using direct IO mode significantly improves data writing performance on the local data storage. We could further prove that RISA is now capable of concurrently receiving, processing and storing data from up to 768 detector channels (3072 MB/s) at 8000 fps on a single-GPU computer in real-time.

Phys. Commun. 219 (2017) 353-360 [1] Does the new version supersede the previous version?: Yes. Reasons for the new version: Extended capabilities for real-time operation with latest UFXCT hardware. Summary of revisions: (i) Add forking and joining of processing pipeline branches (ii) Add runtime (re-)configuration of pipeline stages and connections (iii) Add UDP receiver stage to acquire detector data in real-time (iv) Add high-throughput data dumping Nature of problem: Ultrafast electron beam X-ray computed tomography scanners stream multiple Gigabytes of raw data per second via Ethernet to a control computer. Receiving the data with low latency, real-time image-based control would become possible. For this, data need to be captured from the network, stored on disk, reconstructed and post-processed concurrently. The current total data rate of up to 3072 MB/s requires high-throughput solutions for each of these tasks. Solution method: Using a pipeline scheme, RISA processes incoming raw data in distinct stages (sources, processors, sinks). These are implemented in GPU kernels and are executed concurrently to exploit data parallelism as well as task parallelism. To capture detector data, we implemented a UDP packet capturing stage based on DPDK [2] which acts as a source stage. By allowing the pipeline to fork up into multiple branches, we concurrently acquire, store and process the data. For storing these data, we use the HDF5 format [3]. We achieve the required data rates by writing in direct IO mode onto an SSD array in RAID 0 configuration. Additional comments including restrictions and unusual features: RISA provides a set of general-purpose processing stages which are suitable for generic image stream processing.

Using the data on firms' green innovation achievement and environmental protection investment from China, where the information of D&O Insurance purchases was disclosed, we find robust evidence that insured firms significantly promote firms' environmental responsibility-taking, evident in more green innovation achievement and environmental protection investment. This positive association is more pronounced for firms exposed to stronger environmental regulation. In addition, we document that the moderating effect of environmental regulation is stronger for SOEs, firms with better corporate governance, operating in heavy-polluting industries, and exposed to a stronger institutional environment. Further mechanism analysis shows that public supervision is the underlying channel through which D&O Insurance affects firms' environmental responsibility. Overall, our findings imply that D&O Insurance, one of the important corporate governance mechanisms, motivates directors and officers to actively practice firms' environmental responsibility, and environmental regulation exerts a positive influence over this governance effect. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.",D&O insurance; Environmental regulation; Firms' environmental responsibility,environmental policy; environmental protection; innovation; insurance system; investment; liability; regulatory approach; China,study examines relationship among director officer liability insurance insurance environmental regulation firm environmental responsibility taking using data firm green innovation achievement environmental protection investment china information insurance purchase disclosed find robust evidence insured firm significantly promote firm environmental responsibility taking evident green innovation achievement environmental protection investment positive association pronounced firm exposed stronger environmental regulation addition document moderating effect environmental regulation stronger soes firm better corporate governance operating heavy polluting industry exposed stronger institutional environment mechanism analysis show public supervision underlying channel insurance affect firm environmental responsibility overall finding imply insurance one important corporate governance mechanism motivates director officer actively practice firm environmental responsibility environmental regulation exerts positive influence governance effect 2023 elsevier b v,firm environmental responsibility; innovation achievement environmental; achievement environmental protection; environmental responsibility taking; environmental protection investment; green innovation achievement; environmental responsibility environmental; responsibility environmental regulation; environmental regulation addition; environmental regulation exerts; responsibility taking evident; protection investment china; evident green innovation; environmental regulation stronger; stronger environmental regulation; effect environmental regulation; exposed stronger environmental; study examines relationship; protection investment positive; moderating effect environmental,stronger environmental regulation; insurance environmental regulation; better corporate governance; environmental regulation stronger; innovation achievement environmental,Study;Director Officer Liability Insurance;Environmental Regulation;Firm Environmental Responsibility;Data;Green Innovation;Environmental Protection;Investment;China;Insurance Purchase;Corporate Governance;Operating;Polluting Industry;Institutional Environment,0.7287841671015328,0.6816625598749566,0.5915925112369761

This work aims to study Kombucha fermentation in yerba mate infusion to maximise cellulose production and its processing for film formulation. Yerba mate infusion with sucrose resulted in an extraordinary substrate for Kombucha fermentation with an optimised cellulose production of 19.4 g/l and 0.29 g/g of yield. Filmogenic dispersions were analysed in terms of rheology and particle size distribution. Microscopic characterisation of films exhibited homogeneous surfaces. The addition of glycerol, as well as the solids from the fermented broth, resulted in a significant increase in hydration and a reduction in elastic modulus, ultimate tensile strength and glass transition temperature of the films. The results revealed that the formulation containing the Kombucha fermented media showed similar properties to the glycerol plasticised material. This could be considered a novel result as it may replace the use of traditional plasticisers.

The electronic stopping power is computed from the corrected Bethe formula, with the shell correction derived from numerical calculations with the plane-wave Born approximation (PWBA) for atoms, which were based on an independent-electron model with the Dirac–Hartree–Fock–Slater self-consistent potential for the ground-state configuration of the target atom. The density effect correction is evaluated from an empirical optical oscillator strength (OOS) model based on atomic subshell contributions obtained from PWBA calculations. For projectiles heavier than the electron, the Barkas correction is evaluated from the OOS model, and the Lindhard–Sørensen correction is estimated from an accurate parameterization of its numerical values. The calculated electronic stopping power is completely determined by a single empirical parameter, the mean excitation energy or I value of the material. The radiative stopping power for electrons, and positrons, is evaluated by means of Seltzer and Berger's cross section tables for bremsstrahlung emission. The program yields reliable stopping powers and particle ranges for arbitrary materials and projectiles with kinetic energy larger than a certain cutoff value Ecut, which is specific of each projectile kind. The program is accompanied by an extensive database that contains tables of relevant energy-dependent atomic quantities for all the elements from hydrogen to einsteinium. sbethe may be used to generate basic information for dosimetry calculations and Monte Carlo simulations of radiation transport, and as a pedagogical tool. Program summary: Program title: SBETHE CPC Library link to program files: https://doi.org/10.17632/7zw25f428t.1 Licensing provisions: CC by NC 3.0 Programming language: Fortran 90/95 Nature of problem: The program calculates the stopping power of arbitrary materials for swift charged projectiles with small charges. The material is characterized by its chemical composition, mass density, and the empirical I value. The considered projectiles are electrons, positrons, negative muons, antimuons, protons, antiprotons, and alphas, which are described as point particles characterized by their mass and charge. If the actual I value of the material is known, the results from the program are expected to be reliable for projectiles with kinetic energy higher than a value Ecut, of the order of 1 keV for electrons and positrons, 150 keV for muons and antimuons, 0.75 MeV for protons and antiprotons, and 5 MeV for alpha particles. Solution method: The electronic stopping power is calculated by means of a corrected Bethe formula [1], which combines the conventional Bethe logarithm with the following corrections, 1) the shell correction obtained from calculations based on the plane-wave Born approximation with the self-consistent Dirac–Hartree–Fock–Slater (DHFS) potential of neutral atoms in their ground-state configuration [2], 2) the density effect correction, which accounts for the reduction of the stopping power caused by the dielectric polarization of the medium, 3) a parameterization of the Lindhard–Sørensen correction, which generalizes the Bloch correction for relativistic projectiles, and 4) the Barkas correction, which accounts for differences between the stopping powers of particles and their antiparticles. The density-effect and the Barkas corrections are calculated from a model of the optical oscillator strength (OOS) of the material, which combines the contributions of inner atomic subshells calculated with the DHFS potential, with a classical oscillator model for the contribution of valence electrons, A simple extrapolation formula is used to extend the calculated electronic stopping power to energies less than Ecut to allow the calculation of particle ranges. For electrons and positrons, the radiative stopping power is calculated from numerical tables prepared by Seltzer and Berger [3]. Additional comments including restrictions and unusual features: The calculated stopping power is determined by a single parameter, the mean excitation energy or I value. The program assigns to each material a default I value, derived from the recommendations in the ICRU Report 37, which can be changed by the user. The distribution package includes text files with tables of atomic energy-dependent quantities (subshell optical oscillator strengths, shell corrections, scaled cross sections for bremsstrahlung emission) that are used in the calculations.

Structural FTIR absorption spectra of the prepared glasses reveal distinct absorption bands which are characteristic of both triangular BO3 and tetrahedral BO4 groups within their varying wavenumber vibrational sites. The dopant chromium ions are observed to have no distinct variations on the FTIR spectra because of low dopant percent. Optical absorption characterization indicates that the undoped glass shows only UV absorption which is related to originating from unavoidable trace ferric ions present as impurities in the used chemicals. The Cr2O3-doped glasses reveal additional UV absorption at about 370-385 nm correlated with the hexavalent state of chromium, producing this distinct charge transfer band. Additionally, two visible bands are identified at about 420-400 nm and 580-640 nm originating from trivalent chromium ions with distorted octahedral coordination. Optical parameters including band gap, refractive index, molar refraction, and reflection losses were calculated together with optical dielectric properties, electronic and molar polarizability. In terms of radiation shielding capacity, increasing Cr2O3 mol% of the sample encoded Cr1 that possessed the highest mass (μm) and linear (μ) attenuation coefficients, but the lowest half value layer (HVL) at low and high incident photon energy, results showed that Cr1 can be used in optical and radiation shielding safety. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",Borate glass; Chromium ions; FTIR; HVL; Phys-X/PSD; UV/Vis.,Charge transfer; Chromium compounds; Dielectric properties; Energy gap; Glass; Light absorption; Metal ions; Radiation shielding; Refractive index; Borate glass; Chromium ions; FTIR; Half value layer; Nominal composition; Optical-; Phy-X/PSD; Shielding parameters; UV absorption; UV/Vis; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; boric acid; chromium oxide; oxide; sodium aluminium borate; unclassified drug; absorption; absorption spectroscopy; Article; band gap; controlled study; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; gamma radiation; molar refraction; parameters; radiation attenuation; reflection loss; refraction index; ultraviolet visible absorption spectroscopy; ultraviolet visible spectroscopy,sample nominal composition xcr2o3 60 x b2o3 5al2o3 35na2o x 0 cr0 0 1 cr0 1 0 2 cr0 2 0 4 cr0 4 0 6 cr0 6 0 8 cr0 8 1 cr1 mol prepared via traditional melt quenching route structural ftir absorption spectrum prepared glass reveal distinct absorption band characteristic triangular bo3 tetrahedral bo4 group within varying wavenumber vibrational site dopant chromium ion observed distinct variation ftir spectrum low dopant percent optical absorption characterization indicates undoped glass show uv absorption related originating unavoidable trace ferric ion present impurity used chemical cr2o3 doped glass reveal additional uv absorption 370 385 nm correlated hexavalent state chromium producing distinct charge transfer band additionally two visible band identified 420 400 nm 580 640 nm originating trivalent chromium ion distorted octahedral coordination optical parameter including band gap refractive index molar refraction reflection loss calculated together optical dielectric property electronic molar polarizability term radiation shielding capacity increasing cr2o3 mol sample encoded cr1 possessed highest mass μm linear μ attenuation coefficient lowest half value layer hvl low high incident photon energy result showed cr1 used optical radiation shielding safety 2023 elsevier ltd,mol sample encoded; radiation shielding safety; shielding capacity increasing; energy result showed; possessed highest mass; doped glass reveal; sample nominal composition; term radiation shielding; radiation shielding capacity; polarizability term radiation; traditional melt quenching; melt quenching route; quenching route structural; varying wavenumber vibrational; wavenumber vibrational site; unavoidable trace ferric; correlated hexavalent state; distorted octahedral coordination; gap refractive index; refraction reflection loss,cr2o3 doped glass; 5al2o3 35na2o cr0; b2o3 5al2o3 35na2o; doped glass reveal; glass uv absorption,sample; nominal composition; XCr2O3; B2O3; Al2O3; Na2O; traditional melt quenching route; FTIR absorption spectrum; chromium ion; UV absorption; ferric ion; optical absorption characterization; visible band;,0.0306435534122911,0.2258238411920053,0.15858668540907012

In order to exploit fully the inherent discovery potential of light antinuclei, a reliable description of their production cross sections in cosmic ray interactions is crucial. We provide therefore the cross sections of antideuteron and antihelium-3 production in pp, pHe, Hep, HeHe, p¯p and p¯He collisions at energies relevant for secondary production in the Milky Way, in a tabulated form which is convinient to use. These predictions are based on QGSJET-II-04m and the state of the art coalescence model WiFunC, which evaluates the coalesence probability on an event-by-event basis, including both momentum correlations and the dependence on the emission volume. In addition, we comment on the importance of a Monte Carlo description of the antideuteron production and on the use of event generators in general. In particular, we discuss the effect of two-particle momentum correlations provided by Monte Carlo event generators on antinuclei production.

In our previous work, we presented a practical solution to this problem, where quasi-linear efficiency, both in time and memory, was obtained by utilizing the fast Fourier transform. Here, we present an updated version of our highly-parallelized computer program, named Coulombo-Lattice, that eliminates the necessity of introducing an auxiliary basis set for the wave-function transfer to the computational grid. Here, we instead exploit the properties of the underlying crystal lattice and run calculations on a regular three-dimensional grid superimposed on the original, lower-symmetry lattice. Due to removal of spurious interactions from other supercells, the resulting Coulomb matrix elements are, up to numerical precision, identical to those obtained by the direct summation O(N2) method, yet our code maintains O(Nlog⁡N) scaling. We illustrate our approach by calculations involving up to 1.7 million integrals, and number of atoms reaching up to 2.8 million, for the problem of dopant charging energy for a single phosphorus dopant embedded in a silicon lattice. Next, to emphasize the broad applicability of our code, we show the results for mixed zinc-blend/wurtzite lattice systems, also known as crystal phase quantum dots. Program summary: Program Title: Coulombo-Lattice Licensing provisions: CC BY 4.0 Programming language: C++ Nature of the problem (approx. 50-250 words): Computing the Coulomb matrix elements (Coulomb and exchange integrals), while being a demanding computational task, is a necessary step in a range of quantum mechanical calculations. For example, in the field of nanostructures, such as quantum dots and nanowires or novel single dopant devices, this stage of calculation (even after a series of approximations) is at least an O(N2) operation (a summation over all pairs of N atoms or grid points in the analyzed system). Moreover, calculating the full Coulomb matrix usually requires the computation of thousands of such elements, thus presenting a formidable computational challenge. Solution method (approx. 50-250 words): We provide a ready-to-use implementation for calculating Coulomb matrix elements for a given set of input wavefunctions in LCAO (linear combination of atomic orbitals) form resulting from tight-binding calculation. This implementation is based on the approach introduced in [1,2], by using a fast Fourier transform. In this work, we further significantly improved the method by eliminating the need to introduce wave-function transfer via auxiliary basis set. Additional comments including Restrictions and Unusual features (approx. 50-250 words): The implementation is fully parallelized in a distributed-memory model, using MPI and parallel routines from FFTW [3].

Improving the accuracy order or reducing the dissipation of the WENO by optimizing the linear weights can effectively improve the resolution of this scheme in the smooth regions. However, under the same method, the improvement of shock-capturing abilities is generally limited and may lead to numerical oscillations. In order to simultaneously improve the resolution in discontinuous regions and ensure the performance of the smooth regions, this study uses the shock detector to combine the tangent of hyperbola for interface capturing (THINC) scheme, which is a better discontinuity-capturing scheme, with a given WENO discretization, such as the improved fast WENO (IFWENO) scheme that equips with high economy and does not loss accuracy at any critical point. The hybrid method in this study is an apriori algorithm, which is more efficient and universal than the method in (Takagi et al. J. Comput. Phys. 452(2022)110899). Additionally, the performance of the THINC scheme in different regions near the discontinuity is analyzed in detail through numerical experiments, and a shock detector that can fully exploit the advantages of the THINC scheme is provided. By using this shock detector, several one-dimensional and two-dimensional numerical cases are employed to verify that the hybrid scheme can greatly improve the performance in discontinuities without affecting the flow structure in the smooth regions, which proves the effectiveness of the proposed shock detector and the excellence of the hybrid IFWENO-THINC scheme. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.",Hybrid scheme; Shock capturing; Shock detector; THINC; WENO,Essentially non-oscillatory; Essentially non-oscillatory schemes; Hybrid scheme; Interface capturing scheme; Performance; Shock detectors; Shock-capturing; Smooth regions; Tangent of hyperbola for interface capturing; Weighted essentially non-oscillatory; Numerical methods,weighted essentially non oscillatory weno scheme famous shock capturing scheme high precision numerical simulation classical weno scheme always considered excessive dissipation insufficient resolution near discontinuity improving accuracy order reducing dissipation weno optimizing linear weight effectively improve resolution scheme smooth region however method improvement shock capturing ability generally limited may lead numerical oscillation order simultaneously improve resolution discontinuous region ensure performance smooth region study us shock detector combine tangent hyperbola interface capturing thinc scheme better discontinuity capturing scheme given weno discretization improved fast weno ifweno scheme equips high economy loss accuracy critical point hybrid method study apriori algorithm efficient universal method takagi et al j comput phys 452 2022 110899 additionally performance thinc scheme different region near discontinuity analyzed detail numerical experiment shock detector fully exploit advantage thinc scheme provided using shock detector several one dimensional two dimensional numerical case employed verify hybrid scheme greatly improve performance discontinuity without affecting flow structure smooth region prof effectiveness proposed shock detector excellence hybrid ifweno thinc scheme 2023 elsevier inc,shock detector combine; experiment shock detector; shock detector fully; proposed shock detector; shock detector excellence; additionally performance thinc; interface capturing thinc; detector combine tangent; detector fully exploit; exploit advantage thinc; flow structure smooth; famous shock capturing; improvement shock capturing; shock capturing ability; effectiveness proposed shock; smooth region prof; structure smooth region; capturing ability generally; hyperbola interface capturing; optimizing linear weight,shock detector excellence; numerical experiment shock; loss accuracy critical; apriori algorithm efficient; improvement shock capturing,all rights reserved; ;Weighted Essentially Non Oscillatory (WENO) Scheme;Shock Capturing Scheme;High Precision Numerical Simulation;Classical WENO Scheme;Excessive Dissipation;Insufficient Resolution;Near Discontinuity; ,0.7091331647379999,0.5495689083153307,0.43144385944266006

To bridge this gap, we utilize the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study and the Progress in International Reading Literacy Study (TIMSS-PIRLS) combined 2011 data (N = 180,084 4th-grade students, 37 countries). Our results provide robust evidence that student-level achievement positively predicts enjoyment in math, science, and reading, while the effects of class-level achievement are negative—the Happy-Fish-Little-Pond Effect.

The response is calculated by implementing the finite amplitude method for relativistic quasiparticle random phase approximation. In the new version, we have implemented the following features: (i) meson-exchange interactions, (ii) low-rank method for calculating induced densities and currents, (iii) generalized minimal residual method (GMRES), (iv) evaluation of the nucleon localization function, (v) extraction of the QRPA transition matrix elements and eigenfrequencies, (vi) evaluation of the H11 part of the induced Hamiltonian, (vii) multipole excitation operators up to J≤5 are now included. Program summary: Program title: DIRQFAM v2.0.0 CPC Library link to program files: https://doi.org/10.17632/6gv8nxg4ns.2 Licensing provisions: GPLv3 Programming language: Fortran 90. External routines/libraries: BLAS/LAPACK, version 3.1. or higher. Journal reference of previous version: A. Bjelčić, T. Nikšić, Comp. Phys. Comm. 253, 107184 (2020). Does the new version supersede the previous version?: Yes Nature of problem: Multipole response of deformed even-even open-shell nuclei can be calculated using the quasiparticle finite amplitude method (QFAM), based on the relativistic self-consistent mean-field models. The particle-hole channel is described by a zero-range relativistic effective interaction or interaction based on meson exchange, while the particle-particle channel of the effective inter-nucleon interaction is described by a separable finite-range pairing force. The method can be applied to perform systematic studies of collective modes even in heavy deformed nuclei. Solution method: The current implementation computes the multipole response by solving the QFAM equations in a self-consistent iteration scheme. At each iteration the QFAM solutions are updated using the GMRES method. The QFAM amplitudes are expanded in the simplex-y harmonic oscillator basis.

Previous studies on the prawn reported a similar level of genetic diversity in both hatchery and wild populations, although it is believed that a small number of brooders are generally carried out in hatcheries. Here, thirteen microsatellite loci were used to observe and characterize the genetic diversity in hatchery and wild populations of the prawn. These microsatellite loci were also used to investigate the prawn mate choice. Two experiments of mate choice were done in 1000-liter tanks containing 48 mating partners from four different broodstocks. Newly hatched larvae were daily observed and used for parental analysis to reveal their parents as successful mating pairs. The instinctive mate choice that occurred in the mating tanks was thus disclosed for the first time. The level of genetic diversity, including the allelic richness and observed and expected heterozygosities, was shown not to significantly differ among hatchery and wild populations (P > 0.05). Based on the analysis of pairwise relatedness among mating partners and internal relatedness of larvae, the prawn prefers to mate with partners from different broodstock. Evidently, the internal relatedness of larvae according to the successful mating pairs was significantly lower than in the random mating scenario (P < 0.01). This mating instinct is hypothesized to be important for sustaining genetic diversity in populations of the prawn. This is the first report on inbreeding avoidance of giant freshwater prawn. Future studies on how prawn can recognize partners from different broodstocks are awaiting. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.",Genetic relatedness; Inbreeding avoidance; Microsatellite; Non-random mating; Parentage analysis,,giant freshwater prawn macrobrachium rosenbergii economically important specie cultured tropical sub tropical country previous study prawn reported similar level genetic diversity hatchery wild population although believed small number brooder generally carried hatchery thirteen microsatellite locus used observe characterize genetic diversity hatchery wild population prawn microsatellite locus also used investigate prawn mate choice two experiment mate choice done 1000 liter tank containing 48 mating partner four different broodstocks newly hatched larva daily observed used parental analysis reveal parent successful mating pair instinctive mate choice occurred mating tank thus disclosed first time level genetic diversity including allelic richness observed expected heterozygosity shown significantly differ among hatchery wild population p 0 05 based analysis pairwise relatedness among mating partner internal relatedness larva prawn prefers mate partner different broodstock evidently internal relatedness larva according successful mating pair significantly lower random mating scenario p 0 01 mating instinct hypothesized important sustaining genetic diversity population prawn first report inbreeding avoidance giant freshwater prawn future study prawn recognize partner different broodstocks awaiting 2023 elsevier b v,hatchery wild population; diversity hatchery wild; genetic diversity hatchery; level genetic diversity; internal relatedness larva; giant freshwater prawn; successful mating pair; genetic diversity population; characterize genetic diversity; genetic diversity including; sustaining genetic diversity; avoidance giant freshwater; similar level genetic; time level genetic; observe characterize genetic; diversity including allelic; broodstock evidently internal; evidently internal relatedness; hatchery thirteen microsatellite; based analysis pairwise,broodstocks awaiting 2023; giant freshwater prawn; freshwater prawn future; genetic diversity hatchery; hatchery wild population,Giant Freshwater Prawn ;Macrobrachium Rosenbergii ;Economically Important ;Cultured ;Tropical/SubTropical Country ;Previous Study ;Prawn ;Reported ;Similar Level,0.2817466108788143,0.0532830198077105,0.0

The mean haplotype diversity was high (0.762±0.044) and the mean nucleotide diversity was low (0.003±0.0003). The longest genetic distance of 0.243 (P<0.05) was observed between the samples collected from Chabahar and Bushehr and the lowest of −0.048 (P>0.05) between the samples collected from Bandar Abbas and Bushehr. The mean values of Tajima's D and Fu's Fs were respectively calculated as −0.232 and 0.485 (P>0.05). Analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) showed a high intra-population genetic diversity and a low inter-population diversity, which suggested a high gene flow among the study areas. The present findings suggested, probably the population of yellowtail scad in Chabahar constitutes a independent gene pool of other regions, and despite the unity of the populations of Bandar Abbas and Bushehr, their molecular diversity is acceptable. These results can help genetically manage Atule mate populations in the study areas and manage stocks and monitor genetic variations in this species. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.",AMOVA; mtDNA; Oman Sea; Persian Gulf; Population genetics; Yellowtail scad,,study investigated genetic structure yellowtail scad atule mate population based mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase subunit gene sequence collecting 90 specimen atule mate bushehr bandar abbas chabahar iran mitochondrial dna extracted using ammonium acetate method pcr reaction performed using primer pair nucleotide sequence mitochondrial coi gene pcr product sequenced 13 haplotype identified evaluating sequence one haplotype common within sampling area mean haplotype diversity high 0 762 0 044 mean nucleotide diversity low 0 003 0 0003 longest genetic distance 0 243 p 0 05 observed sample collected chabahar bushehr lowest 0 048 p 0 05 sample collected bandar abbas bushehr mean value tajima fu f respectively calculated 0 232 0 485 p 0 05 analysis molecular variance amova showed high intra population genetic diversity low inter population diversity suggested high gene flow among study area present finding suggested probably population yellowtail scad chabahar constitutes independent gene pool region despite unity population bandar abbas bushehr molecular diversity acceptable result help genetically manage atule mate population study area manage stock monitor genetic variation specie 2023 elsevier b v,bandar abbas bushehr; atule mate population; specimen atule mate; scad atule mate; collected bandar abbas; manage atule mate; atule mate bushehr; mate bushehr bandar; bushehr bandar abbas; bandar abbas chabahar; observed sample collected; yellowtail scad atule; sample collected bandar; population bandar abbas; abbas bushehr molecular; abbas chabahar iran; structure yellowtail scad; longest genetic distance; mate population study; analysis molecular variance,mitochondrial dna extracted; collecting 90 specimen; gene pcr product; coi gene pcr; study investigated genetic,genetic structure;yellowtail scad;atule mate;mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase subunit;gene sequence;90 specimen;bushehr;bandar abbas;chabahar;iran;mitochondrial dna,0.1389179134105023,0.0,0.12413320152410935

Owen (Math Program 9:358–370, 1975) presents an allocation scheme for the joint profit of the firms through the cooperative game defined by formulating linear programming problems for obtaining optimal production planning. However, since the values of the resources are measured by the shadow prices which are the optimal dual solution to the linear programming problem for the grand coalition, the excess resources in the grand coalition have no value, and players receive no payoff for the excess resources possessed. Moreover, even when some coalitions cannot be formed, the Owen solution does not change and it is not affected by such situations because it is calculated using the optimal dual solution in the linear production planning problem only for the grand coalition. To cope with these difficulties, we revise the definition of the linear production game by introducing a characteristic function taking into account not only the maximized profit but also the value of the excess resources. To the revised linear production game, we introduce a solution concept with the following favorable aspects. (i) The shadow prices of the resources for all coalitions are utilized for calculating the payoffs of the players. (ii) When some coalitions cannot be formed, such situations are appropriately reflected in the payoffs. (iii) The proposed payoff vector is in the core of the revised linear production game. To demonstrate these properties, we give the numerical examples, and calculate the corresponding proposed payoff vectors.

Executive function, as an essential cognitive ability, is a core cognitive element that supports children’s mathematical processing. However, there have only been a few studies focusing on the effects of each component of executive function on different mathematical abilities (mathematical operation, spatial imagination, and logical thinking). Primary school is the key period during which children acquire basic mathematical ability. However, limited studies have examined the developmental relationships between the various components of executive function and the different mathematical abilities of children at different grade levels. Consequently, the purpose of this study was to examine the role of each component of executive function in the different mathematical abilities of children at different grade levels. A total of 812 children in grades 3, 4, 5, and 6 completed tests covering mathematical operations, spatial imagination, and logical thinking to measure their basic mathematical ability. The Stroop task and the GO/NOGO task were used to measure interference inhibition and response inhibition. Children’s working memory span was assessed using forward and backward digit span tasks. Children’s working memory updating was investigated using simple and difficult digital updating tasks. Children’s cognitive flexibility was examined using digit shifting tasks. Finally, a correlation analysis and a structural equation model (SEM) were used to investigate the impact of each component of executive function on children’s mathematical abilities at different grade levels. The results revealed that working memory was the most important factor affecting children’s mathematical skills, over inhibitory control and cognitive flexibility. Specifically, working memory span was the most statistically significant predictor of ability with respect to mathematical operations, while working memory updating was a stronger predictor of spatial imagination and logical thinking ability from grade 3 to grade 6. In a further analysis of the data, we divided the four grades into two stages, with grades 3 and 4 set as the younger group and grades 5 and 6 set as the older group. The results showed working memory span to be the most important predictor of mathematical operation ability, spatial imagination ability, and logical thinking ability in the junior grades. In the older students, the predictive effect of working memory span on basic math ability dropped, and the effects of working memory updating and cognitive flexibility on basic math ability increased. These results indicate that different components of executive function play various roles in different mathematical abilities in school-age children, and that this pattern of influence appears to change as children progress through the grades. Specifically, the lower-order components of executive function components, specifically working memory span, were found to play an important role in the development of three mathematical abilities in younger students, while the higher-order executive function components, specifically working memory updating and cognitive flexibility, were found to play a more important role in processing mathematical tasks in older students. © 2023, Science Press.

An essential step of the argument is a new normal form for grammars with context operators, in which every nonterminal symbol defines only strings of odd length in left contexts of even length: the even-odd normal form.

Using sufficient airborne ozone profiles during 2012–2018, this study reveals the tropospheric ozone distributions over four cities located in coastal regions of southern China. The 7-year mean tropospheric ozone profiles in the four cities consistently show a double-maxima profile, with a local maximum at 1 km altitude and the other in the middle-to-upper troposphere. Seasonally, springtime ozone is larger than the annual mean throughout the troposphere, while ozone in summer is high in the middle-to-upper troposphere, leading to largest vertical variations among seasons. Ozone in the middle-to-upper troposphere is lower in autumn than in spring and summer. The winter ozone is characterized with a minimum in the lower troposphere, and low values in the middle-to-upper troposphere, leading to least vertical variations among seasons. We untangle the causes for these complicated vertical ozone variations using the GEOS-Chem model. The tropospheric ozone over southern China is partitioned into locally produced ozone, regionally transported native ozone, imported ozone from outside of China (foreign ozone) and natural stratospheric ozone. The results suggest that the springtime ozone abundance is due to the enhanced import of foreign and stratospheric ozone and the intensified regional transport processes of native ozone. In summer, local ozone production is enhanced and regional transport of ozone in the middle-to-upper troposphere is strengthened due to upward air motions, while such transport becomes weaker in autumn leaving low ozone in the middle-to-upper troposphere. In winter, the intensive westerly jets promote foreign and stratospheric ozone again in the middle-to-upper troposphere, but the local ozone production and regional transport are sharply reduced, resulting in low ozone near the surface. This study provides new insights into regional ozone profiles and reveals the significance of vertical ozone variations on surface ozone prevention strategy. © 2023 The Authors",GEOS-Chem; IAGOS; Southern China; Tropospheric ozone variations,Atmospheric chemistry; Coastal zones; Ozone layer; Troposphere; GEOS-chem; IAGOS; Ozone variation; Regional transport; Southern China; Stratospheric ozone; Tropospheric ozone; Tropospheric ozone variation; Upper troposphere; Vertical variation; Ozone; atmospheric pollution; coastal zone; EOS; ozone; seasonality; stratosphere; troposphere; China,surface ozone pollution strongly coupled ozone variation ground using sufficient airborne ozone profile 2012 2018 study reveals tropospheric ozone distribution four city located coastal region southern china 7 year mean tropospheric ozone profile four city consistently show double maximum profile local maximum 1 km altitude middle upper troposphere seasonally springtime ozone larger annual mean throughout troposphere ozone summer high middle upper troposphere leading largest vertical variation among season ozone middle upper troposphere lower autumn spring summer winter ozone characterized minimum lower troposphere low value middle upper troposphere leading least vertical variation among season untangle cause complicated vertical ozone variation using geos chem model tropospheric ozone southern china partitioned locally produced ozone regionally transported native ozone imported ozone outside china foreign ozone natural stratospheric ozone result suggest springtime ozone abundance due enhanced import foreign stratospheric ozone intensified regional transport process native ozone summer local ozone production enhanced regional transport ozone middle upper troposphere strengthened due upward air motion transport becomes weaker autumn leaving low ozone middle upper troposphere winter intensive westerly jet promote foreign stratospheric ozone middle upper troposphere local ozone production regional transport sharply reduced resulting low ozone near surface study provides new insight regional ozone profile reveals significance vertical ozone variation surface ozone prevention strategy 2023 author,middle upper troposphere; ozone middle upper; upper troposphere leading; vertical ozone variation; foreign stratospheric ozone; altitude middle upper; high middle upper; upper troposphere local; local ozone production; upper troposphere lower; upper troposphere winter; upper troposphere seasonally; upper troposphere strengthened; stratospheric ozone middle; transport ozone middle; low ozone middle; season ozone middle; middle upper; summer high middle; troposphere ozone summer,springtime ozone abundance; troposphere seasonally springtime; seasonally springtime ozone; springtime ozone larger; suggest springtime ozone,surface ozone pollution; ozone variation; airborne ozone profile; tropospheric ozone distribution; four city; coastal region; southern China; 7 year mean; double maximum profile; local maximum; 1 km altitude; middle upper troposphere; seasonally; springtime ozone; annual mean,0.1460605862339083,0.178446591456957,0.35705932786131594

In the current study, seryl tRNA synthetase of Leishmania donovani (LdSerRS) and its mutants were purified and characterized through biochemical and structural methods. Purified LdSerRS was found to be enzymatically active and exhibited more alpha helices in secondary structure. The enzymatic activity of purified protein was observed as highest near physiological temperature and pH. Mutation in ATP binding residues (R295 and E297) demonstrated reduction in the affinity for cofactor with no significant deviation in secondary structure. In vitro inhibition studies with ureidosulfocoumarin derivatives helped to identify Comp 5l as a specific inhibitor for leishmanial SerRS that showed lesser potency towards purified HsSerRS. The identified compound presented competitive mode of inhibition for LdSerRS and also revealed druglikeness along with very low toxicity for human macrophages. Structural analysis of protein and ligand complex depicted the binding of Comp 5l into the cofactor binding site of LdSerRS with high affinity succeeded by validation employing molecular dynamics simulations.

However, whether maternal preconceptional inflammation alters metabolic and behavioral phenotypes in offspring remains poorly understood. Main methods: Female mice were injected with either lipopolysaccharide or saline to establish the inflammatory model and then allowed to mate with normal males. Offspring from both control and inflammatory dams were subsequently given chow diet and water ad libitum, without any challenge, for metabolic and behavioral tests. Key findings: Male offspring derived from inflammatory mothers (Inf-F1) maintained on the chow diet developed impaired glucose tolerance and hepatic ectopic fat deposition. Hepatic transcriptome sequencing showed the largest gene changes related to the metabolic pathway. Moreover, Inf-F1 mice exhibited anxiety- and depressive-like behaviors and were accompanied by higher serum corticosterone concentration and lower glucocorticoid receptor abundance in the hippocampus.

While the importance of measuring PM2.5 has been demonstrated, doing so remotely remains challenging. In this study, methodologies for the assessment of aerosol PM2.5 and chemical composition based on a combination of regional and global models and active remote sensing were evaluated against surface observations from the KORUS-AQ campaign. The model outputs from the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) and GEOS-Chem were used and were available at the KORUS-AQ campaign data archive. For remote sensing, aerosol extinction and derived aerosol types available from NASA Langley Airborne Differential Absorption Lidar (DIAL)/High Spectral Resolution Lidar (HSRL) flying onboard DC-8 aircraft were used. A revised version of the algorithm, which incorporates size-specific aerosol dry mass extinction efficiencies for sulfate, nitrate, and ammonia as well as organic matter, is also presented. The PM2.5 concentration estimates were compared with measurements taken at the ground stations. The estimated mean absolute error between the ground station measurements and the remote-sensing-based methodologies was significantly lower compared to the models. The data analysis has shown that uncertainties in relative humidity values, the presence of particles larger than 2.5 μm in diameter, and the abundance of black carbon and organic matter in Asian aerosol were unlikely to explain the differences between measured and predicted surface PM2.5. Local meteorology was found to play a key role influencing the spatiotemporal variability of aerosols and the most important factor determining the agreement between the estimated and ground site-measured PM2.5.

The two open-pit mines have been expanding their mining production scale since 2005, with frequent mining activities; and the expansion of the pits and the discharge of solid waste will undoubtedly increase the land use and cause the destruction of vegetation. Therefore, we plan to visualize the change in vegetation cover in Dexing City from 2005 to 2020 and the expansion of the two open-pit mines by calculating changes of the Fractional Vegetation Cover (FVC) in the mining area using remote sensing technology. In this study, we calculated the FVC of Dexing City in 2005, 2010, 2015 and 2020 using data from NASA Landsat Database via ENVI image analysis software, plotted the FVC reclassified maps via ArcGIS, and conducted field investigations in the mining areas of Dexing City. In this way, we can visualize the spatial and temporal changes of vegetation cover in Dexing City from 2005 to 2020, and appreciate the situation of mining expansion and its solid waste discharge in Dexing City. The results of this study showed that the vegetation cover of Dexing City remained stable from 2005 to 2020, as the expansion of mining scale and mine pits was accompanied by active environmental management and land reclamation, setting a positive example for other mining cities. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.",Environmental management; Mining damage; Mining engineering; Remote sensing,environmental management; image analysis; land use change; Landsat; mining; remote sensing; solid waste; spatiotemporal analysis; vegetation cover; Article; calculation; China; environmental management; mine waste; mining; remote sensing; residential area; satellite imagery; solid waste; solid waste management; spatiotemporal analysis; vegetation; city; environmental monitoring; procedures; China; Dexing; Jiangxi; copper; China; Cities; Copper; Environmental Monitoring; Solid Waste,dexing city important mining city china abounding copper ore lead ore zinc ore metal resource two large open pit mine territory dexing copper mine yinshan mine two open pit mine expanding mining production scale since 2005 frequent mining activity expansion pit discharge solid waste undoubtedly increase land use cause destruction vegetation therefore plan visualize change vegetation cover dexing city 2005 2020 expansion two open pit mine calculating change fractional vegetation cover fvc mining area using remote sensing technology study calculated fvc dexing city 2005 2010 2015 2020 using data nasa landsat database via envi image analysis software plotted fvc reclassified map via arcgis conducted field investigation mining area dexing city way visualize spatial temporal change vegetation cover dexing city 2005 2020 appreciate situation mining expansion solid waste discharge dexing city result study showed vegetation cover dexing city remained stable 2005 2020 expansion mining scale mine pit accompanied active environmental management land reclamation setting positive example mining city 2023 elsevier inc,vegetation cover dexing; cover dexing city; open pit mine; change vegetation cover; fractional vegetation cover; showed vegetation cover; large open pit; vegetation cover fvc; solid waste undoubtedly; waste undoubtedly increase; city remained stable; pit accompanied active; remote sensing technology; data nasa landsat; nasa landsat database; envi image analysis; image analysis software; analysis software plotted; arcgis conducted field; conducted field investigation,pit expanding mining; 2020 expansion mining; china abounding copper; mining city 2023; abounding copper ore,Dexing City;Important mining city;China;Abounding copper ore;Lead ore;Zinc ore;Metal resource;Two large open pit mine;Dexing Copper Mine;Yinshan Mine;Expansion;Mining production scale,0.0423512933066516,0.353619403998436,0.1672621538064301

Although the implementation of air pollution control strategies in recent years has alleviated PM2.5 pollution, O3 pollution and the synergistic pollution of PM2.5 and O3 have become more serious. To understand the underlying chemical interaction mechanisms between PM2.5 and O3, we applied the modified Weather Research and Forecasting model with Chemistry (WRF-Chem) to study the effects of aerosol-photolysis feedback and heterogeneous reactions on the two pollutants and revealed the contribution of different mechanisms in different seasons and regions in Yangtze River Delta (YRD) in eastern China. We found that, through the aerosol-photolysis feedback, PM2.5 decreased the surface photolysis rates JNO2 and JO1D, resulting in a decrease in O3 concentration in the VOC-sensitive area and a slight increase in the NOx-sensitive area. The heterogeneous reactions reduced O3 concentration in the YRD in spring, autumn and winter by consuming HxOy. While in summer, the heterogeneous absorption of NOx decreased O3 in the NOx-sensitive areas and increased O3 in the VOC-sensitive areas. Heterogeneous reactions also promoted the secondary formation of fine sulfate and nitrate aerosols, especially in winter. Through the combined effect of two chemical processes, PM2.5 can lead to a decrease in O3 concentration of −3.3 ppb (−7.6 %), −2.2 ppb (−4.0 %), −2.9 ppb (−6.3 %), and − 5.9 ppb (−18.7 %), in spring, summer, autumn and winter in YRD. Therefore, if the PM2.5 concentration decreases, the weakening effect of PM2.5 on the ozone concentration will be reduced, resulting in the aggravation of ozone pollution. This study is important for understanding the synergistic pollution mechanism and provides a scientific basis for the coordinated control of urban air pollution. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.",Heterogeneous reaction; Ozone; Photolysis reaction; PM2.5; Synergistic pollution,Aerosols; Air pollution; Feedback; Nitrogen oxides; Ozone; River pollution; Sulfur compounds; Weather forecasting; East China; Heterogeneous interactions; Heterogeneous reactions; NO x; Photochemical interactions; Photolysis reaction; PM 2.5; Sensitive area; Synergistic pollution; Yangtze river delta; Photolysis; aerosol; atmospheric pollution; ozone; particulate matter; photochemistry; photolysis; weather forecasting; China; Yangtze Delta,rapid development chinese city accompanied air pollution although implementation air pollution control strategy recent year alleviated pm2 5 pollution o3 pollution synergistic pollution pm2 5 o3 become serious understand underlying chemical interaction mechanism pm2 5 o3 applied modified weather research forecasting model chemistry wrf chem study effect aerosol photolysis feedback heterogeneous reaction two pollutant revealed contribution different mechanism different season region yangtze river delta yrd eastern china found aerosol photolysis feedback pm2 5 decreased surface photolysis rate jno2 jo1d resulting decrease o3 concentration voc sensitive area slight increase nox sensitive area heterogeneous reaction reduced o3 concentration yrd spring autumn winter consuming hxoy summer heterogeneous absorption nox decreased o3 nox sensitive area increased o3 voc sensitive area heterogeneous reaction also promoted secondary formation fine sulfate nitrate aerosol especially winter combined effect two chemical process pm2 5 lead decrease o3 concentration 3 3 ppb 7 6 2 2 ppb 4 0 2 9 ppb 6 3 5 9 ppb 18 7 spring summer autumn winter yrd therefore pm2 5 concentration decrease weakening effect pm2 5 ozone concentration reduced resulting aggravation ozone pollution study important understanding synergistic pollution mechanism provides scientific basis coordinated control urban air pollution 2023 elsevier b v,sensitive area heterogeneous; voc sensitive area; nox sensitive area; area heterogeneous reaction; sensitive area increased; aerosol photolysis feedback; sensitive area slight; increase nox sensitive; surface photolysis rate; rapid development chinese; recent year alleviated; applied modified weather; area slight increase; photolysis feedback heterogeneous; feedback heterogeneous reaction; city accompanied air; important understanding synergistic; development chinese city; chinese city accompanied; strategy recent year,alleviated pm2 pollution; china aerosol photolysis; air pollution 2023; development chinese city; pm2 pollution o3,; Rapid Development; Chinese City; Air Pollution; PM2.5; O3; Synergistic Pollution; Chemical Interaction Mechanism; Modified Weather Research Forecasting Model; Chemistry WRFChem; Aerosol Photolysis Feedback; H,0.2918891095876259,0.3710550502219947,0.2970484787356105

Am. Chem. Soc. 143 (2021) 12715–12724], which opened a new chapter in the field of ESIPT. Based on density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT), the proton transfer processes of 3NTF in toluene, dichloromethane and acetonitrile were studied. By optimizing the structure of the ground (S0) state and first excited (S1) state of 3NTF in different solvents, the hydrogen-bond parameters and proton-transfer potential energy curves were calculated. It was shown that although photo-excitation enhanced the intramolecular hydrogen bonding strength and thus promoted the occurrence of ESIPT, the solvent polarities inhibited the enhancement of the hydrogen bond of S1 state, which was not conducive to ESIPT. The electron spectra analyses were consistent with experimental data, which confirmed the rationality of molecular configurations. The time-evolved excited state dynamics simulation was performed based on the optimized structure of 3NTF, indicating that the ESIPT was an ultrafast photochemical reaction less than 180 fs. Moreover, we compared the potential energy surfaces of ESIPT, electronic structures based on natural transition orbitals (NTOs) method and electron-hole isosurfaces for the 3NTF and the traditional flavone molecule (3NHF), concluded that the unusually large Stokes shift fluorescence of 3NTF was mainly caused by the coupling of ESIPT and twisting intramolecular charge transfer (TICT), and the 3NTF isomer had the more nπ* character in the electron transition process. The nπ* ICT significantly increased with the decrease of solvent polarities, affecting the molecular photophysical properties, this made it more widely used in biomedical, photochemical, materials science and other fields. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.",Charge transfer; Dual-fluorescent phenomena; Dynamic simulation; Excited state intramolecular thiol proton transfer; Hydrogen bond; Potential energy surface,Density functional theory; Dichloromethane; Electron transitions; Electronic structure; Excited states; Fluorescence; Image enhancement; Molecular physics; Oxygen; Potential energy; Potential energy surfaces; Proton transfer; Quantum chemistry; Rate constants; Solvents; Density-functional-theory; Dual-fluorescent phenomenon; Dynamics simulation; Effect of solvents; Excited state intramolecular thiol proton transfer; Excited-states; Photophysical properties; Potential-energy surfaces; Solvent polarity; Transfer properties; Hydrogen bonds,recently dual fluorescent phenomenon excited state intramolecular thiol proton transfer esipt 3 thiolflavone derivative 3ntf reported chou coworkers first time j chem soc 143 2021 12715 12724 opened new chapter field esipt based density functional theory dft time dependent density functional theory tddft proton transfer process 3ntf toluene dichloromethane acetonitrile studied optimizing structure ground s0 state first excited s1 state 3ntf different solvent hydrogen bond parameter proton transfer potential energy curve calculated shown although photo excitation enhanced intramolecular hydrogen bonding strength thus promoted occurrence esipt solvent polarity inhibited enhancement hydrogen bond s1 state conducive esipt electron spectrum analysis consistent experimental data confirmed rationality molecular configuration time evolved excited state dynamic simulation performed based optimized structure 3ntf indicating esipt ultrafast photochemical reaction le 180 f moreover compared potential energy surface esipt electronic structure based natural transition orbitals ntos method electron hole isosurfaces 3ntf traditional flavone molecule 3nhf concluded unusually large stokes shift fluorescence 3ntf mainly caused coupling esipt twisting intramolecular charge transfer tict 3ntf isomer nπ character electron transition process nπ ict significantly increased decrease solvent polarity affecting molecular photophysical property made widely used biomedical photochemical material science field 2023 elsevier b v,density functional theory; traditional flavone molecule; functional theory dft; dependent density functional; recently dual fluorescent; reported chou coworkers; toluene dichloromethane acetonitrile; concluded unusually large; stokes shift fluorescence; charge transfer tict; theory tddft proton; bond parameter proton; compared potential energy; potential energy curve; potential energy surface; energy curve calculated; polarity inhibited enhancement; based density functional; proton transfer potential; dual fluorescent phenomenon,12724 opened new; recently dual fluorescent; science field 2023; enhancement hydrogen bond; tddft proton transfer,Dual Fluorescent Phenomenon;Intramolecular Thiol Proton Transfer;ESIPT;3NTF;Chou Coworkers;J Chem Soc;DFT;TDDFT;Proton Transfer Process;Tolu,0.4242196797060121,0.4064899819555085,0.4614547448659584

Its behavior is often difficult to investigate owing to the limited resolution of meteorological field data and inconsistent model implementations. This study investigated the detailed behavior of 25 combinations of in- and below-cloud wet scavenging models using high-resolution (1 km × 1 km) meteorological input. These combinations were all implemented in the Weather Research and Forecasting-Chemistry model, thereby enabling consistent evaluation. The 1-km-resolution simulations were compared with simulations obtained previously using 3-km-resolution meteorological field data. Results revealed that rainfall of &lt;1 mm/h is critical for simulation accuracy. The 1-km results revealed better representation of rainfall than that revealed by the 3-km results, but with spatiotemporal variability in accuracy. Owing to their sensitivity to rainfall, single-parameter wet deposition models showed improvements in performance in the 1-km simulations relative to that in the 3-km simulations. The multiparameter models showed more robust performance in terms of both simulations, and the Roselle–Mircea model presented the best performance among the 25 models considered. Wind transport showed substantial influence on the removal of atmospheric 137Cs, and it was nonnegligible even during periods in which wet deposition was dominant. The 1-km-resolution simulations effectively reproduced local-scale 137Cs concentrations but with deviations in timing, mainly because of biased wind direction. These findings indicate the necessity for a refined wind and dispersion model for local-scale simulation of 137Cs concentration. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.",Below-cloud scavenging; Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant accident; In-cloud scavenging; Online-coupled modeling; Wet deposition; WRF-Chem,Atmospheric chemistry; Atmospheric movements; Deposition; Nuclear energy; Nuclear fuels; Nuclear power plants; Nuclear reactor accidents; Uncertainty analysis; Weather forecasting; Below-cloud; Below-cloud scavenging; Field data; Fukushima Dai-ichi Nuclear Power Plant accidents; In-cloud scavenging; Meteorological fields; Online coupled models; Wet deposition; Wet scavenging; WRF/Chem; Rain; cesium 137; rain; atmospheric transport; cesium isotope; cloud; computer simulation; nuclear accident; rainfall; spatial variation; temporal variation; wet deposition; wind direction; Article; atmosphere; below cloud scavenging model; cloud; concentration (parameter); controlled study; data accuracy; forecasting; Fukushima nuclear accident; in cloud scavenging model; meteorology; model; online system; simulation; weather; wet deposition; wind,wet deposition remains important source uncertainty modeling atmospheric transport 137cs following fukushima daiichi nuclear power plant accident behavior often difficult investigate owing limited resolution meteorological field data inconsistent model implementation study investigated detailed behavior 25 combination cloud wet scavenging model using high resolution 1 km 1 km meteorological input combination implemented weather research forecasting chemistry model thereby enabling consistent evaluation 1 km resolution simulation compared simulation obtained previously using 3 km resolution meteorological field data result revealed rainfall lt 1 mm h critical simulation accuracy 1 km result revealed better representation rainfall revealed 3 km result spatiotemporal variability accuracy owing sensitivity rainfall single parameter wet deposition model showed improvement performance 1 km simulation relative 3 km simulation multiparameter model showed robust performance term simulation roselle mircea model presented best performance among 25 model considered wind transport showed substantial influence removal atmospheric 137cs nonnegligible even period wet deposition dominant 1 km resolution simulation effectively reproduced local scale 137cs concentration deviation timing mainly biased wind direction finding indicate necessity refined wind dispersion model local scale simulation 137cs concentration 2023 elsevier b v,resolution meteorological field; meteorological field data; field data result; field data inconsistent; limited resolution meteorological; wet deposition dominant; concentration deviation timing; enabling consistent evaluation; reproduced local scale; deposition remains important; result spatiotemporal variability; data result revealed; owing limited resolution; effectively reproduced local; wet deposition remains; parameter wet deposition; period wet deposition; remains important source; important source uncertainty; source uncertainty modeling,137cs following fukushima; research forecasting chemistry; power plant accident; accident behavior difficult; plant accident behavior,wet deposition ;uncertainty modeling ;atmospheric transport ;137Cs ;Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant ;meteorological field data ;model implementation ;high resolution ;1 km ;Weather Research Forecasting Chemistry model,0.175264542375495,0.2976547050514223,0.33272245119653027

We show that the barely circulating energetic electrons can satisfy the resonance condition with the TAE, mainly due to vanishing transit frequency near the phase space circulating/trapped separatrix.

Rev. Lett. 105 155001). The impact of global effects on the radial profile of the plasma density has been investigated in a previous study for a particular TCV discharge with negligible particle source, satisfying the ‘zero particle flux’ (ZPF) condition. A radially local flux-tube analysis, reconstructing the dependence of the peaking of the density profile on the main physical parameters, invoking the ZPF constraint, was pursued close to mid-radius in (Mariani et al 2018 Phys. Plasmas 25 012313). This analysis was followed by a global one (Mariani et al 2019 Plasma Phys. Control. Fusion 61 064005), where local quasi-linear (QL) and nonlinear (NL) results were compared with global simulations, showing small global effects on the density peaking. However, these gradient-driven (GD) global runs considered Krook-type heat and particle sources to keep temperature and density profiles fixed on average, which differ from the experimental radially localized sources. To remove this possible bias on the results, a different evaluation of the density peaking for the same case is performed here, based on global NL hybrid simulations where the temperature profiles are [still] kept fixed with the Krook-type sources, however the density profile relaxes in a flux-driven way (with zero particle source). The new hybrid simulations show a good agreement with the old GD runs. A global QL model is also developed and applied using the output from linear global runs, to estimate ratios of fluxes, showing a good agreement with the flux-tube results of global NL GD simulations. The effect of collisions on the results is also investigated, in order to evaluate their impact on the radial variation of the density peaking. © 2023 The Author(s).

Fluids 13 2593-6) introduced the scalings of adiabatic plasma compression. Basically, if the shape of the external plasma boundary and the aspect ratio are preserved during the compression, then the density, kinetic pressure, beta and current scale respectively as n ∼ C 3 , p ∼ C 5 , B ∼ C 2 , β ∼ C , I t ∼ C , where C is the linear compression ratio, that is, the ratio between initial and final major radii. In this work, we show analytically, by expanding the Grad-Shafranov equation in terms of C, that the deviation to the Furth-Yoshikawa scaling is related to the Shafranov shift that arises when beta increases at large compression ratios. There is an obvious effect of the Shafranov shift because the axis is moved to a region with larger volume element, and an indirect effect, associated to the relation between flux and radius. The latter effect adds to the first, and is of the same order of magnitude. The result is that the pressure increases less than the C 5 scaling, which can have a significant impact on the fusion power achieved at maximum compression. The analytical results are backed up by equilibrium simulations carried out with the CHEASE code. Equilibria are obtained for different values of C, with conservation of the total fluxes, q profile, and entropy of the plasma. The agreement of the theory and simulations is very good when the boundary of the plasma is circular and the aspect ratio small.

The sky view factor (SVF) is a crucial structure index of buildings and it combines height and density attributes. These attributes have impacts on the air temperature(Tair). However, there are few studies on the association between SVF and Tair across block scales. In this paper, we designed ten scenarios according to the characteristics of Beijing's commercial and residential buildings. Furthermore, we used ENVI-met, a microclimate simulation model, to simulate the Tair in designed scenarios and evaluate the impact of SVF on the Tair of each component. A number of significant observations were noted based on the experimental results: (1) from 10:00 to 17:00, there is a positive correlation between SVF and Tair; from 18:00 to 9:00 the next day, there is a negative correlation between SVF and Tair (2) the relationship between building shadow ratio (BSR) and Tair is not a single negative correlation: at sunrise, BSR is the maximum in a day, but the cooling effect of BSR on Tair is not obvious because of the weak solar radiation. In addition, the arrangement of building directions has a great influence on the relationship between BSR and Tair (3) for the same building scenario, BSR decreases with the increase of SVF (4) the synergistic effect of SVF and BSR on Tair in the daytime can be divided into two periods, the separation time points are 7:00 and 14:00. This study can provide instructions for urban design in optimizing building layout and mitigating the urban heat impact on human health. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.",Building shadow ratio; ENVI-met; Simulation; Sky view factors; Urban micro-climate,,urban building morphology one important effect urban thermal environment ute sky view factor svf crucial structure index building combine height density attribute attribute impact air temperature tair however study association svf tair across block scale paper designed ten scenario according characteristic beijing commercial residential building furthermore used envi met microclimate simulation model simulate tair designed scenario evaluate impact svf tair component number significant observation noted based experimental result 1 10 00 17 00 positive correlation svf tair 18 00 9 00 next day negative correlation svf tair 2 relationship building shadow ratio bsr tair single negative correlation sunrise bsr maximum day cooling effect bsr tair obvious weak solar radiation addition arrangement building direction great influence relationship bsr tair 3 building scenario bsr decrease increase svf 4 synergistic effect svf bsr tair daytime divided two period separation time point 7 00 14 00 study provide instruction urban design optimizing building layout mitigating urban heat impact human health 2023 elsevier b v,correlation svf tair; positive correlation svf; based experimental result; separation time point; single negative correlation; negative correlation sunrise; negative correlation svf; day negative correlation; impact human health; correlation sunrise bsr; thermal environment ute; environment ute sky; ute sky view; sky view factor; crucial structure index; combine height density; block scale paper; characteristic beijing commercial; beijing commercial residential; envi met microclimate,instruction urban design; characteristic beijing commercial; solar radiation addition; urban building morphology; beijing commercial residential,Urban Building Morphology;UTE Sky View Factor (SVF);Crucial Structure Index;Building Combine Height Density;Attribute Impact Air Temperature (TAIR);ENVIMet Microclimate Simulation Model;Building Shadow Ratio (BS,0.1755834664090038,0.1545909675697021,0.4179569004371274

Chemical cues in the aquatic environment have an impact on the individual and group behavior of fish, and differences in these behavioral responses might be related to the body size of group members. Here, we used juvenile crucian carp (Carassius carassius) as an animal model to examine the effects of different cues and group mate body sizes on the individual and group behavior of shoaling fish. Three group mate body size (small, large, and mixed size) and three pheromone (rearing tank water, food, and CACs) treatments were combined in our study, with each treatment having 16 groups of five fish. We found that the individual swimming speed of the mixed group increased after injecting rearing water and food cues in the tank. After injecting CACs, the individual swimming speed of both the small and mixed groups increased, while that of the large group did not change. After the injection of CACs, the group speed of the small group was higher than that of the large and mixed groups. After the food cues were added to the tank, the synchronization of speed of the small group was higher than that of the mixed and large groups. Both the interindividual distance and nearest-neighbor distance of the mixed group remained unchanged after injecting CACs. Our study indicated that the impact of external cues on the individual and collective behavior of fish is related to the difference in body size of group mates. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.",Chemical alarm cues; Group alignment; Group cohesion; Group polarization; Heterogeneity,body size; chemical cue; cyprinid; group behavior; heterogeneity; pheromone; rearing; swimming,chemical alarm cue cacs play key role predator sbnd prey relationship fish chemical cue aquatic environment impact individual group behavior fish difference behavioral response might related body size group member used juvenile crucian carp carassius carassius animal model examine effect different cue group mate body size individual group behavior shoaling fish three group mate body size small large mixed size three pheromone rearing tank water food cacs treatment combined study treatment 16 group five fish found individual swimming speed mixed group increased injecting rearing water food cue tank injecting cacs individual swimming speed small mixed group increased large group change injection cacs group speed small group higher large mixed group food cue added tank synchronization speed small group higher mixed large group interindividual distance nearest neighbor distance mixed group remained unchanged injecting cacs study indicated impact external cue individual collective behavior fish related difference body size group mate 2023 elsevier b v,mate body size; group mate body; body size group; individual swimming speed; speed small group; small group higher; mixed group increased; individual group behavior; body size small; swimming speed small; size group mate; swimming speed mixed; body size individual; speed small mixed; related body size; difference body size; size small large; large mixed size; synchronization speed small; small large mixed,fish chemical cue; prey relationship fish; fish group mate; group behavior fish; fish difference behavioral,chemical cue; aquatic environment; behavioral response; body size; group mate; fish; pheromone; rearing tank; water food; CACS; treatment; individual swimming speed; synchronization speed; interindividual distance; nearest neighbor distance,0.2091810653396823,0.2220090021501975,0.1325179785170156

Mate corneas were recovered into Kerasave or Optisol-GS (27 pairs) and stored at 2°C to 8°C for 14 days. Corneas were evaluated by trained eye bank technicians, and study parameters were compared between the initial and final evaluations. Endothelial cell density (ECD), hexagonality (HEX), and coefficient of variation (CV) were evaluated by specular microscopy, and central corneal thickness (CCT) was examined by optical coherence tomography after 1, 3, 7, and 14 days of storage. Corneal transparency was scored using slit lamp examination at days 1 and 14.Results:Average ECD, HEX, and CV for the Kerasave (2653 ± 303 cells/mm2, 57 ± 4%, and 36 ± 3%) and Optisol-GS (2623 ± 306 cells/mm2, 57 ± 5%, and 36 ± 4%) groups were not significantly different at day 1. There was also no difference at any other study time points (all P &gt; 0.05). ECD did not significantly change from day 1 to day 14 in either group (P &gt; 0.05), but a statistically significant change in HEX and CV was observed between day 1 and day 14 in both groups (P &lt; 0.01). Average CCT measured at day 1 for corneas stored in Kerasave was 622 ± 49 m and those stored in Optisol-GS was 580 ± 35 m (P &lt; 0.01). The difference in CCT measurements was not significantly different at day 14 (Kerasave: 674 ± 46 m vs. Optisol-GS: 647 ± 58 m, P &gt; 0.05). Corneal transparency was not significantly different between the 2 groups at day 1 or day 14.Conclusions:The corneal quality and clinically relevant parameters including ECD, endothelial morphometry, and corneal transparency were not different in corneas stored in Kerasave or Optisol-GS for 14 days. The initial difference in CCT between the 2 groups decreased at day 14. These results demonstrated that Kerasave corneal storage solution preserves the corneal endothelium similarly to Optisol-GS. © 2023 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

Plasmas 29 083507), we have developed a non-linear moment model for electrons that self-consistently captures non-Maxwellian electron energy distribution function effects. The model does not rely in the local approximation and the transport coefficients are calculated by expanding the distribution function into Hermite polynomials and by taking moments of the Boltzmann equation, including the collision operator for elastic and inelastic collisions with arbitrary cross sections. This model captures the classical Fick’s, Fourier’s, and Ohm’s law as well as Soret, Dufour, and Peltier effects. In addition, novel non-local transport phenomena appear as a result of spatial gradients of the kurtosis of the distribution function. In this paper, we discuss on the transport effects by analyzing two collisional models: constant collision frequency and constant cross section. We estimate the order of magnitude of the transport processes in non-equilibrium electrons by analyzing the Langmuir probe measurements of a low-pressure argon inductively-coupled discharge. The results show that, under these conditions, the transport produced by the spatial gradients in the kurtosis of the distribution function produces a heat-flux contribution that is of the same order of magnitude as the Fourier and Dufour’s effects. These transport effects are beyond the local field or the electron gradient expansions, commonly used in the low-temperature plasma modeling. © 2023 IOP Publishing Ltd.",electron energy distribution functions; equations of fluid dynamics; gas discharges; partially ionized plasma,Boltzmann equation; Dissociation; Electromagnetic induction; Electron energy analyzers; Electron energy levels; Electron temperature; Heat flux; Inductively coupled plasma; Langmuir probes; Poisson equation; Transport properties; Distribution-functions; Electron energy distribution functions; Equation of fluid dynamic; Fluid-dynamics; Fourier; Gas discharge; Partially ionized plasma; Spatial gradients; Transport effects; Transport process; Distribution functions,previous work alvarez laguna et al 2022 phys plasma 29 083507 developed non linear moment model electron self consistently capture non maxwellian electron energy distribution function effect model rely local approximation transport coefficient calculated expanding distribution function hermite polynomial taking moment boltzmann equation including collision operator elastic inelastic collision arbitrary cross section model capture classical fick fourier ohm law well soret dufour peltier effect addition novel non local transport phenomenon appear result spatial gradient kurtosis distribution function paper discus transport effect analyzing two collisional model constant collision frequency constant cross section estimate order magnitude transport process non equilibrium electron analyzing langmuir probe measurement low pressure argon inductively coupled discharge result show condition transport produced spatial gradient kurtosis distribution function produce heat flux contribution order magnitude fourier dufour effect transport effect beyond local field electron gradient expansion commonly used low temperature plasma modeling 2023 iop publishing ltd,gradient kurtosis distribution; kurtosis distribution function; spatial gradient kurtosis; previous work alvarez; calculated expanding distribution; energy distribution function; expanding distribution function; distribution function hermite; distribution function paper; distribution function produce; temperature plasma modeling; arbitrary cross section; cross section estimate; section estimate order; estimate order magnitude; contribution order magnitude; produced spatial gradient; flux contribution order; gradient expansion commonly; work alvarez laguna,plasma modeling 2023; 2022 phys plasma; plasma 29 083507; al 2022 phys; kurtosis distribution function,previous work;Alvarez Laguna et al 2022;Phys.

Control. Fusion 63 115006), is analyzed in order to investigate the origin of the I p spike and its relation with magnetic stochasticity. The I p spike is associated to a current density (j φ) profile relaxation which appears to result from Shear Alfvén Wave (SAW) propagation along stochastic field lines, as proposed by Boozer (2019 Plasma Phys. Control. Fusion 61 024002; 2020 Phys. Plasmas 27 102305), possibly complemented by a macroscopic E×B flow structure. Using axisymmetric JOREK simulations involving a mean field Ohm’s law, we verify that the level of hyper-resistivity associated to SAWs is consistent with the prediction made in (Boozer 2019 Plasma Phys. Control. Fusion 61 024002; Boozer 2020 Phys. Plasmas 27 102305), which connects the I p spike with the level of stochasticity. The relaxation comprises two main phases, the first one corresponding to a fast (0.1 ms) and almost complete j φ flattening in the q &lt; 2 region, while the second one is longer (0.5 ms) and corresponds to a more gradual, global and incomplete j φ flattening.

We randomly assigned 162 5th- and 6th-graders to briefly learn decomposed, common-unit, or point labels. Children then completed measures of decimal magnitude processing and representation. We found that the place-value labels (i.e., decomposed and common-unit labels) each showed unique advantages in reducing the whole-number bias, and common-unit labels also reduced componential processing. No difference was found in the ratio effect – which served as an index of the precision of decimal magnitude representation - among children from the three conditions.

This 31-plex Y-STR system, SureID® Y-comp, is designed for biological samples from forensic casework and reference samples from forensic DNA database. To validate the suitability of this novel kit, many developmental works including size precision testing, sensitivity, male specificity testing, species specificity, PCR inhibitors, stutter precision, reproducibility, suitability for use on DNA mixture and parallel testing of different capillary electrophoresis devices were performed. Mutation rates were investigated using 295 DNA-confirmed father-son pairs. The results demonstrate that the SureID® Y-comp Kit is time-efficient, accurate, and reliable for various case-type samples. It possessed a higher discrimination power and can be a stand-alone kit for male identification. Moreover, the simply acquired additional Y-STR loci will be conductive to construct a robust database. Even if various commercial Y-STR kits are used in distinct forensic laboratories, a wider trans-database retrieval will become feasible with the effort of the SureID® Y-comp Kit. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.",31-plex Y-STR system; Developmental validation; Forensic genetics; Multiplex PCR assay,,study new complementary str system includes 31 locus developed dys522 dys388 dyf387s1a b dys510 dys587 dys645 dys531 dys593 dys617 gata_a10 dys622 dys552 dys508 dys447 dys527a b dys446 dys459a b dys444 dys557 dys443 dys626 dys630 dys526a dyf404s1a b dys520 dys518 dys526b 31 plex str system sureid comp designed biological sample forensic casework reference sample forensic dna database validate suitability novel kit many developmental work including size precision testing sensitivity male specificity testing specie specificity pcr inhibitor stutter precision reproducibility suitability use dna mixture parallel testing different capillary electrophoresis device performed mutation rate investigated using 295 dna confirmed father son pair result demonstrate sureid comp kit time efficient accurate reliable various case type sample possessed higher discrimination power stand alone kit male identification moreover simply acquired additional str locus conductive construct robust database even various commercial str kit used distinct forensic laboratory wider trans database retrieval become feasible effort sureid comp kit 2023 elsevier b v,sureid comp kit; system sureid comp; sureid comp designed; demonstrate sureid comp; effort sureid comp; comp designed biological; result demonstrate sureid; feasible effort sureid; developmental work including; work including size; pcr inhibitor stutter; capillary electrophoresis device; electrophoresis device performed; device performed mutation; performed mutation rate; mutation rate investigated; confirmed father son; father son pair; son pair result; pair result demonstrate,dys630 dys526a dyf404s1a; developed dys522 dys388; dys522 dys388 dyf387s1a; dyf404s1a dys520 dys518; dys526a dyf404s1a dys520,Study;New;Complementary;STR system;31 locus;Dys522;Dys388;Dyf387s1a;Dys510;Dys587;Dys645;Dys531;Dys593; ,0.052784977386521,0.0,0.19603539171685896

Only serotonin reuptake inhibitors and cognitive-behavioral therapy have been demonstrated efficacious in randomized controlled trials. Psilocybin is a psychedelic drug with growing evidence for safety and efficacy in treatment of depression. This study aimed to pilot test the feasibility, tolerability, safety, and efficacy of psilocybin treatment of adults with BDD. Methods: In this open-label trial, 12 adults (8 women, 4 men) with moderate-to-severe non-delusional BDD that had been unresponsive to at least one serotonin reuptake inhibitor trial received a single oral dose of psilocybin 25 mg. There was no control group. Psychological support was provided before, during, and after the dosing session. The primary outcome measure for efficacy was the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Disorder Scale Modified for BDD (BDD-YBOCS) score during 12 weeks of assessments after dosing. Results: All participants completed dosing and all follow-up assessments. BDD-YBOCS scores decreased significantly over 12 weeks of follow-up (p < .001) with a large effect size (partial eta squared = 0.54), and significant changes from baseline were present at week 1 and persisted through week 12. Secondary efficacy measures of BDD symptoms, conviction of belief, negative affect, and disability also improved significantly, and no serious adverse events occurred. At week 12, seven participants (58%) were rated responders, based on ≥30% decrease in BDD-YBOCS. Conclusion: This study provides promising preliminary support for psilocybin as a treatment of BDD, warranting future controlled studies. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",Body dysmorphic disorder; Clinical trial; Hallucinogen; Psilocybin,psilocybine; serotonin uptake inhibitor; adult; Article; body dysmorphic disorder; clinical article; clinical feature; coronavirus disease 2019; disability; dizziness; drug efficacy; drug safety; drug tolerability; fatigue; female; follow up; headache; human; insomnia; male; mood disorder; nausea; pilot study; pneumonia; psychological care; remission; somnolence; visual hallucination; Yale Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale,objective body dysmorphic disorder bdd often severe condition individual preoccupied misperceptions appearance defective ugly serotonin reuptake inhibitor cognitive behavioral therapy demonstrated efficacious randomized controlled trial psilocybin psychedelic drug growing evidence safety efficacy treatment depression study aimed pilot test feasibility tolerability safety efficacy psilocybin treatment adult bdd method open label trial 12 adult 8 woman 4 men moderate severe non delusional bdd unresponsive least one serotonin reuptake inhibitor trial received single oral dose psilocybin 25 mg control group psychological support provided dosing session primary outcome measure efficacy yale brown obsessive compulsive disorder scale modified bdd bdd ybocs score 12 week assessment dosing result participant completed dosing follow assessment bdd ybocs score decreased significantly 12 week follow p 001 large effect size partial eta squared 0 54 significant change baseline present week 1 persisted week 12 secondary efficacy measure bdd symptom conviction belief negative affect disability also improved significantly serious adverse event occurred week 12 seven participant 58 rated responder based 30 decrease bdd ybocs conclusion study provides promising preliminary support psilocybin treatment bdd warranting future controlled study 2023 elsevier ltd,serotonin reuptake inhibitor; bdd ybocs score; rated responder based; ybocs score decreased; ugly serotonin reuptake; reuptake inhibitor cognitive; objective body dysmorphic; large effect size; partial eta squared; significant change baseline; reuptake inhibitor trial; ybocs conclusion study; men moderate severe; defective ugly serotonin; inhibitor cognitive behavioral; growing evidence safety; feasibility tolerability safety; decrease bdd ybocs; score decreased significantly; condition individual preoccupied,trial psilocybin psychedelic; ugly serotonin reuptake; psilocybin psychedelic drug; psilocybin treatment bdd; efficacy psilocybin treatment,; Body Dysmorphic Disorder (BDD); Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor (SRI); Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT); Psilocybin; Psychedelic Drug; Depression; Yale Brown Obsessive Compulsive Disorder Scale (YBOC,0.0919155426782699,0.3232845644903129,0.3439939558907815

We investigated this unusual phenomenon by considering the rare occurrence of polyandrous mating and the extremely male-biased operational sex ratio (OSR) at the beginning of the mating season. Theoretically, male-biased OSR can intensify competition for mates, leading to increased polyandry. We estimated OSR (male/female) as 32.7 and 9.1 at the beginning and end of the mating period, respectively. Next, we estimated the rate of polyandry in a population on a weekly basis, based on our new finding that the rate of polyandry can be estimated stochastically from the total number of spermatangia attached to one of the two seminal receptacles within a female. We found that the female squid sustains their highly monoandrous mating regime despite the fact that the OSR is extremely male-biased. Furthermore, there were no significant changes in the polyandry rate during the reproductive season. These results suggest that the squid mating system was not influenced by seasonal changes in OSR. Here, we discuss the evolutionary mechanism of how monoandry persists in this species. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Deep-sea squid; Monogamy; Operational sex ratio; Polyandry,deep-sea organism; monogamy; polyandry; reproductive strategy; seasonal variation; sex ratio,unlike cephalopod firefly squid watasenia scintillans highly monoandrous investigated unusual phenomenon considering rare occurrence polyandrous mating extremely male biased operational sex ratio osr beginning mating season theoretically male biased osr intensify competition mate leading increased polyandry estimated osr male female 32 7 9 1 beginning end mating period respectively next estimated rate polyandry population weekly basis based new finding rate polyandry estimated stochastically total number spermatangia attached one two seminal receptacle within female found female squid sustains highly monoandrous mating regime despite fact osr extremely male biased furthermore significant change polyandry rate reproductive season result suggest squid mating system influenced seasonal change osr discus evolutionary mechanism monoandry persists specie 2023 author exclusive licence springer verlag gmbh germany part springer nature,extremely male biased; unlike cephalopod firefly; monoandry persists specie; author exclusive licence; part springer nature; investigated unusual phenomenon; rare occurrence polyandrous; operational sex ratio; intensify competition mate; competition mate leading; mate leading increased; population weekly basis; weekly basis based; stochastically total number; total number spermatangia; number spermatangia attached; system influenced seasonal; discus evolutionary mechanism; evolutionary mechanism monoandry; mechanism monoandry persists,female female squid; suggest squid mating; squid mating influenced; cephalopod firefly squid; female squid,Cephalopod ;Firely Squid ;Watasenia Scintillans ;Monoandrous ;Polyandrous Mating ;Male Biased ;Operational Sex Ratio ;OSR ; ,0.094037527275308,0.273912378574968,0.32967401452598855

However, which behavior intervention is more appropriate and when remain elusive. Here, we unexpectedly found that stressed mice experiencing social isolation exhibited less anxiety than those experiencing social contact. Within the first 24 h after returning to their previous social environment, mice experienced acute restraint stress (ARS) displayed low social interest but simultaneously received excessive social disturbance from their cage mates, indicating a critical time window for social isolation to balance the conflict. To screen brain regions that were differentially activated between the poststress social isolation and poststress social contact groups, we performed ΔFosB immunostaining and found that ΔFosB + signals were remarkably increased in the vDG of poststress social isolation group compared with poststress social contact group. There were no significant differences between the two groups in the other anxiety- and social-related brain regions, such as prelimbic cortex, infralimbic cortex, nucleus accumbens, etc. These data indicate that vDG is closely related to the differential phenotypes between the poststress social isolation and poststress social contact groups. Electrophysiological recording, further, revealed a higher activity of vDG in the poststress social isolation group than the poststress social contact group. Chemogenetically inhibiting vDG excitatory neurons within the first 24 h after ARS completely abolished the anxiolytic effects of poststress social isolation, while stimulating vDG excitatory neurons remarkably reduced anxiety-like behaviors in the poststress social contact group. Together, these data suggest that the activity of vDG excitatory neurons is essential and sufficient to govern the anxiolytic effect of poststress social isolation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report to uncover a beneficial role of temporal social isolation in acute stress-induced anxiety. In addition to the critical 24-h time window, activation of vDG is crucial for ameliorating anxiety through poststress social isolation. © The Authors",Acute stress; Anxiolytic effect; Social contact; Social isolation; Ventral dentate gyrus,anxiolytic agent; clozapine; acute stress; amygdala; analysis of variance; animal experiment; animal model; anxiety; Article; central nucleus (amygdala); data analysis; dentate gyrus; electrophysiological procedures; electrophysiology; elevated plus maze test; hippocampus; immunohistochemistry; lateral hypothalamus; locomotion; mouse; nonhuman; open field test; patch clamp technique; phenotype; plasmid; radial arm maze test; social behavior; social interaction; social isolation; ventral dentate gyrus,aversive stress people either choose return previously familiar social environment tend adopt temporary social withdrawal buffer negative emotion however behavior intervention appropriate remain elusive unexpectedly found stressed mouse experiencing social isolation exhibited le anxiety experiencing social contact within first 24 h returning previous social environment mouse experienced acute restraint stress ar displayed low social interest simultaneously received excessive social disturbance cage mate indicating critical time window social isolation balance conflict screen brain region differentially activated poststress social isolation poststress social contact group performed δfosb immunostaining found δfosb signal remarkably increased vdg poststress social isolation group compared poststress social contact group significant difference two group anxiety social related brain region prelimbic cortex infralimbic cortex nucleus accumbens etc data indicate vdg closely related differential phenotype poststress social isolation poststress social contact group electrophysiological recording revealed higher activity vdg poststress social isolation group poststress social contact group chemogenetically inhibiting vdg excitatory neuron within first 24 h ar completely abolished anxiolytic effect poststress social isolation stimulating vdg excitatory neuron remarkably reduced anxiety like behavior poststress social contact group together data suggest activity vdg excitatory neuron essential sufficient govern anxiolytic effect poststress social isolation best knowledge first report uncover beneficial role temporal social isolation acute stress induced anxiety addition critical 24 h time window activation vdg crucial ameliorating anxiety poststress social isolation author,poststress social isolation; poststress social contact; social contact group; social isolation poststress; isolation poststress social; effect poststress social; vdg poststress social; social isolation group; vdg excitatory neuron; anxiolytic effect poststress; group poststress social; experiencing social contact; isolation group poststress; experiencing social isolation; window social isolation; social isolation author; poststress social; behavior poststress social; activated poststress social; compared poststress social,anxiety poststress social; induced anxiety addition; group anxiety social; anxiety addition critical; anxiety social related,Aversive stress; social environment; social withdrawal; negative emotion; behavior intervention; mouse; social isolation; anxiety; social contact; poststress social isolation; poststress social contact; δfosb; vdg; prelimbic cortex; infralimbic cortex; nucleus,0.4586670293889426,0.2354264855057758,0.4921361960879743

This effect may be explained by functional difficulties, also known as role limitations, that result from experiencing physical health issues (i.e., physical role limitations) and emotional health issues (i.e., emotional role limitations). Physical and emotional role limitations might be especially salient in low-income, urban mother-child dyads because of elevated levels of environmental stressors. We conducted mediation models with a sample of 133 low-income, urban, predominantly African American and Latino families. Our analyses indicated direct links between maternal depression and emotional and physical role limitations, as well as a direct link between maternal depression and child reading (but not math) abilities. Analyses suggested that maternal depression was indirectly linked with child reading abilities through emotional role limitations.

A simple 1-D thermal math model was developed for thermal analysis using the lumped-parameter assumption, and three different thermal design cases of hydrazine propellant pipeline layouts were considered. By increasing heater power densities and applying modified worst cold boundary conditions for thermal analysis, the thermal design performance for the propellant pipelines of an actual satellite could be improved and verified through thermal vacuum test. After the successful operation of the pipeline heaters in the real space environment, some important lessons learned on thermal design improvements of hydrazine monopropellant pipeline layout could be attained from the present case study.

The purpose of this study was to characterize the proteomic profile in CED aqueous humor (AH) after penetrating keratoplasty (PKP). We collected AH samples (n = 6/group) from CED patients underwent PKP and cataract patients, respectively. The label-free quantitative proteomic analysis was performed to identify the differentially-expressed proteins (DEPs). The biological functions of DEPs were evaluated using Gene Ontology (GO) analysis and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genome (KEGG) analysis. The protein-protein interaction (PPI) network construction was employed to distinguish the hub proteins of DEPs, and the selected proteins were validated by parallel reaction monitoring (PRM). The human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were adopted to investigate the effect of biglycan (BGN) on inflammatory response, and the subsequent outcomes of inflammation on human corneal endothelial cells (HCECs). A total of 174 DEPs were identified in CED AH of patients underwent PKP, including 102 up-regulated proteins and 72 down-regulated proteins. Bioinformatics analysis revealed the significant enrichment of cytokine-mediated signaling pathway and extracellular matrix (ECM) organization in the up-regulated proteins, as well as the alterations of cellular components, including the increase of collagen and complement component C1 complex, and reduction in extracellular exosomes. A hub protein cluster of 15 proteins was determined by Molecular Complex Detection (MCODE), including FN1, BGN, COMP, COL11A1, COLA3A1, and COL1A1. Moreover, BGN promoted pro-inflammatory cytokine (such as TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6) production in PBMCs through NF-κB signaling pathway, which subsequently resulted in HCECs death. These findings provided a systemic protein profile of AH in CED patients after corneal transplantation, with the alterations implicated in cytokine-mediated signaling, ECM, complement system, and exsomes. The identified proteins and signaling pathways probably paved the novel insight into understanding the pathogenesis of the disease. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",Aqueous humor; Corneal endothelial decompensation; Corneal transplantation; Pathogenesis; Proteomics,biglycan; collagen; collagen type 1; collagen type 3; collagen type I alpha 1 chain; complement component C1; dexamethasone plus tobramycin; ELAV like protein 2; fibronectin; hydrocortisone; interleukin 1beta; interleukin 6; prednisolone; tacrolimus; tumor necrosis factor; adult; aged; aqueous humor; Article; cell death; clinical article; complement system; controlled study; cornea endothelium; cornea transplantation; cytokine signaling; differential gene expression; down regulation; drug dose reduction; exosome; extracellular matrix; female; human; human cell; human tissue; KEGG; male; NF kB signaling; penetrating keratoplasty; peripheral blood mononuclear cell; protein protein interaction; proteomics; upregulation,corneal endothelial decompensation ced major cause long term graft failure underlying mechanism remain unclear purpose study characterize proteomic profile ced aqueous humor ah penetrating keratoplasty pkp collected ah sample n 6 group ced patient underwent pkp cataract patient respectively label free quantitative proteomic analysis performed identify differentially expressed protein deps biological function deps evaluated using gene ontology go analysis kyoto encyclopedia gene genome kegg analysis protein protein interaction ppi network construction employed distinguish hub protein deps selected protein validated parallel reaction monitoring prm human peripheral blood mononuclear cell pbmcs adopted investigate effect biglycan bgn inflammatory response subsequent outcome inflammation human corneal endothelial cell hcecs total 174 deps identified ced ah patient underwent pkp including 102 regulated protein 72 regulated protein bioinformatics analysis revealed significant enrichment cytokine mediated signaling pathway extracellular matrix ecm organization regulated protein well alteration cellular component including increase collagen complement component c1 complex reduction extracellular exosomes hub protein cluster 15 protein determined molecular complex detection mcode including fn1 bgn comp col11a1 cola3a1 col1a1 moreover bgn promoted pro inflammatory cytokine tnf α il 1β il 6 production pbmcs nf κb signaling pathway subsequently resulted hcecs death finding provided systemic protein profile ah ced patient corneal transplantation alteration implicated cytokine mediated signaling ecm complement system exsomes identified protein signaling pathway probably paved novel insight understanding pathogenesis disease 2023 elsevier ltd,cytokine mediated signaling; patient underwent pkp; mediated signaling pathway; mediated signaling ecm; signaling pathway subsequently; signaling pathway extracellular; underwent pkp cataract; enrichment cytokine mediated; implicated cytokine mediated; ced patient underwent; underwent pkp including; group ced patient; pathway subsequently resulted; signaling ecm complement; corneal endothelial decompensation; protein signaling pathway; patient corneal transplantation; pkp cataract patient; understanding pathogenesis disease; pathway extracellular matrix,patient corneal transplantation; corneal transplantation alteration; corneal transplantation; pkp cataract patient; gene ontology analysis,Corneal endothelial decompensation (CED) ;Major cause ;Long term graft failure ;Underlying mechanism ;Remain unclear ;Purpose study ;Characterize proteomic profile ;CED aqueous humor (,0.1489869829005776,0.473178139600223,0.35211633920794605

This disorder can lead to various phys-ical and behavioral problems and ultimately reduce the quality of life. Sleep disorders are also among the complaints of patients with FC. Objectives: In this study, we aimed to investigate the prevalence of sleep disorders in children with chronic FC. Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted on 140 children aged 5 to 12 with chronic FC referred to the specialized pediatrics clinic of Amirkabir Hospital of Arak, Iran. The functional constipation was diagnosed based on Rome IV criteria. Children and their parents were requested to complete the Children’s Sleep Habits Questionnaire (CSHQ). Data analysis was performed in SPSS version 22 using the chi-square and Mann-Whitney tests to find significant associations at the significance level of 5%. Results: The mean (SD) age of the participants was 7.36 ± 1.6, and most participants were boys (65.7%). The prevalence of sleep disorders in children with chronic FC was 62.9% (95% CI: 54.5-70.2). Sleep resistance and sleep apnea were the most common minor sleep disorders. The prevalence of sleep disorders was significantly higher in girls (81.3%) than in boys (53.3%) with chronic FC (P = 0.001). There was no significant difference in the prevalence of sleep disorders in children with chronic FC aged 5 to 8 and 9 to 12. Conclusions: In the present study, the results showed that the prevalence of sleep disorders in children with chronic FC was signifi-cant, and it was higher compared to other studies conducted on healthy children, and also it was found that girls had a significantly higher rate of sleep disorders than boys. © 2023, Author(s).",Children; Chronic Functional Constipation; Sleep Disorders,anxiety; Article; child; chronic constipation; cross-sectional study; daytime somnolence; female; groups by age; human; Iran; major clinical study; male; nocturnal awakening; nonREM sleep; parasomnia; preschool child; prevalence; school child; sex difference; sleep disorder; sleep disordered breathing; sleep quality; sleep time,background functional constipation fc common problem childhood worldwide disorder lead various phys ical behavioral problem ultimately reduce quality life sleep disorder also among complaint patient fc objective study aimed investigate prevalence sleep disorder child chronic fc method cross sectional study conducted 140 child aged 5 12 chronic fc referred specialized pediatrics clinic amirkabir hospital arak iran functional constipation diagnosed based rome iv criterion child parent requested complete child sleep habit questionnaire cshq data analysis performed spss version 22 using chi square mann whitney test find significant association significance level 5 result mean sd age participant 7 36 1 6 participant boy 65 7 prevalence sleep disorder child chronic fc 62 9 95 ci 54 5 70 2 sleep resistance sleep apnea common minor sleep disorder prevalence sleep disorder significantly higher girl 81 3 boy 53 3 chronic fc p 0 001 significant difference prevalence sleep disorder child chronic fc aged 5 8 9 12 conclusion present study result showed prevalence sleep disorder child chronic fc signifi cant higher compared study conducted healthy child also found girl significantly higher rate sleep disorder boy 2023 author,disorder child chronic; prevalence sleep disorder; sleep disorder child; sleep disorder boy; sleep disorder prevalence; disorder prevalence sleep; sleep disorder significantly; life sleep disorder; minor sleep disorder; rate sleep disorder; sleep resistance sleep; disorder significantly higher; investigate prevalence sleep; difference prevalence sleep; showed prevalence sleep; childhood worldwide disorder; worldwide disorder lead; background functional constipation; child sleep habit; complete child sleep,resistance sleep apnea; sleep disorder complaint; child sleep habit; sleep disorder child; sleep habit questionnaire,functional constipation; sleep disorder; child; chronic FC; Rome IV criterion; CSHQ; data analysis; SPSS; chisquare; MannWhitney test; sleep resistance; sleep apnea; prevalence; girl; boy,0.3605180660758004,0.3169963028953468,0.4312254065034269

This regime is mainly thought to pertain to short-pulse laser-generated ion beams, because of the ion energy fluences required to enter this regime. The regime for was thought to be determined by a dimensionless number, Ξ h . Here it is shown that there is another dimensionless number that needs to be considered.

In particular, we study the behavior of the DQ ROM error bounds by considering L2(Ω) and H01(Ω) POD spaces and l∞(L2) and natural-norm errors. We present some meaningful numerical tests checking the behavior of error bounds. Based on our numerical results, DQ ROM errors are several orders of magnitude smaller than noDQ ones (in which the POD is constructed in a standard way, i.e., without the DQ approach) in terms of the energy kept by the ROM basis. Further, noDQ ROM errors have an optimal behavior, while DQ ROM errors, where the DQ is added to the POD process, demonstrate an optimality/super-optimality behavior. It is conjectured that this possibly occurs because the DQ inner products allow the time dependency in the ROM spaces to make an impact. © 2023, The Author(s).",Difference quotients; Error analysis; Optimality; Proper orthogonal decomposition; Reduced order models,Partial differential equations; Principal component analysis; Burger's equations; Difference quotient; Error bound; Model errors; Optimality; Orthogonal decomposition; Proper Orthogonal; Proper orthogonal decomposition; Reduced order modelling; Reduced-order model; Error analysis,paper prove uniform error bound proper orthogonal decomposition pod reduced order modeling rom burger equation considering difference quotient dqs introduced kunisch volkwein numer math 90 1 117 148 2001 particular study behavior dq rom error bound considering l2 ω h01 ω pod space l l2 natural norm error present meaningful numerical test checking behavior error bound based numerical result dq rom error several order magnitude smaller nodq one pod constructed standard way e without dq approach term energy kept rom basis nodq rom error optimal behavior dq rom error dq added pod process demonstrate optimality super optimality behavior conjectured possibly occurs dq inner product allow time dependency rom space make impact 2023 author,paper prove uniform; volkwein numer math; space make impact; natural norm error; bound proper orthogonal; proper orthogonal decomposition; difference quotient dqs; quotient dqs introduced; dqs introduced kunisch; introduced kunisch volkwein; kunisch volkwein numer; approach term energy; conjectured possibly occurs; bound based numerical; uniform error bound; error bound proper; error bound based; reduced order modeling; present meaningful numerical; meaningful numerical test,numer math 90; volkwein numer math; rom burger equation; l2 h01 pod; pod space l2,Paper;Prove;Uniform Error Bound;Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD);Reduced Order Modeling (ROM);Burger Equation;Difference Quotient (DQ);KunischVolkwein,0.3230465603946972,0.0,0.4452957726167434

This study aims at exploring the effects of three-dimensional morphology characteristics of road-trees on traffic-related PM2.5 distribution through ENVI-met simulations. Firstly, this study verifies the performance of ENVI-met pollutants dispersion model by comparison with field measurements. Then a typical high-density block model is built and thirteen simulation groups under varied morphology parameters of height of tree, height of trunk and width of crown are designed in ENVI-met. The results indicate that planting 10 m-height roadside trees is effective for pollutant dilution in the vertical direction, and the trees with high trunk height have a strong capacity in clearing the traffic-related PM2.5 at pedestrian level and promote the diffusion of PM2.5, but excessive crown width would cause PM2.5 escaping from the block hardly and increase pedestrian exposure levels.

The object of this prospective cohort research was to identify fibrinolytic characteristics in patients with pancreatic trauma and to identify the correlation to mortality. Method: A prospective screening of traumatic pancreatic injury patients was done for five years. The fibrinolytic status of patients was determined by thromboelastography (TEG). The percentage reduction in clot strength 30 min (LY30) after the time of maximal clot strength was utilized to distinguish the fibrinolytic phenotype of individuals, including fibrinolytic shutdown (SD), physiologic fibrinolysis (PHYS) and hyperfibrinolysis (HF). Two cohorts, transient fibrinolytic shutdown (TSD) and persistent fibrinolytic shutdown (PSD), were divided according to whether fibrinolytic shutdown persisted within one week. Demographics, injury severity, characteristics of pancreatic injury, treatment, and outcomes were compared. Result: A total of 180 cases enrolled, aged 42(interquartile range 32–51) years, 88% males, 97% were blunt trauma. The median ISS was 19(IQR 10–25), and 76% were AAST grade III to V (high-grade). At admission, there were 159 cases of SD (88%), 15 cases of PHYS (8%) while 6 cases of HF (3%). Of these, the TSD cohort included 54 patients (34%), while the PSD cohort included 105 patients (66%). Compared with the TSD cohort, the PSD cohort had more severe injury (ISS 21[IQR 12–27] vs 16[IQR 9–22], p = 0.006) and a higher proportion of AAST high-grade (83% vs 67%, p = 0.035). Persistent fibrinolytic shutdown was associated with operative treatment (odds ratio [OR] 3.111; 95%CI 1.146–8.447; p = 0.026), associated intra-abdominal injury (OR 8.331; 95% CI 1.301–53.336; p = 0.025) and admission LY30 (OR 0.016; 95% CI 0.002 - 0.120; p < 0.001). It was an independent predictor of mortality (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 4.674; 95% CI 1.03 to 21.14; p = 0.045). Conclusion: Fibrinolytic shutdown especially persistence of this phenotype is more common in traumatic pancreatic injury than PHYS and HF, which related with mortality. Risk factors including LY30 at admission, intra-abdominal injury and operative treatment were associated with the persistent fibrinolytic shutdown. Sheltered the patients from these risk factors seems to be beneficial, which need to be confirmed by further large-scale studies. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",Fibrinolysis shutdown; Mortality; Non-operative treatment; Traumatic pancreatic injury,,purpose feature fibrinolytic system modification relationship prognosis still unknown traumatic pancreatic injury object prospective cohort research identify fibrinolytic characteristic patient pancreatic trauma identify correlation mortality method prospective screening traumatic pancreatic injury patient done five year fibrinolytic status patient determined thromboelastography teg percentage reduction clot strength 30 min ly30 time maximal clot strength utilized distinguish fibrinolytic phenotype individual including fibrinolytic shutdown sd physiologic fibrinolysis phys hyperfibrinolysis hf two cohort transient fibrinolytic shutdown tsd persistent fibrinolytic shutdown psd divided according whether fibrinolytic shutdown persisted within one week demographic injury severity characteristic pancreatic injury treatment outcome compared result total 180 case enrolled aged 42 interquartile range 32 51 year 88 male 97 blunt trauma median i 19 iqr 10 25 76 aast grade iii v high grade admission 159 case sd 88 15 case phys 8 6 case hf 3 tsd cohort included 54 patient 34 psd cohort included 105 patient 66 compared tsd cohort psd cohort severe injury i 21 iqr 12 27 v 16 iqr 9 22 p 0 006 higher proportion aast high grade 83 v 67 p 0 035 persistent fibrinolytic shutdown associated operative treatment odds ratio 3 111 95 ci 1 146 8 447 p 0 026 associated intra abdominal injury 8 331 95 ci 1 301 53 336 p 0 025 admission ly30 0 016 95 ci 0 002 0 120 p 0 001 independent predictor mortality adjusted odds ratio aor 4 674 95 ci 1 03 21 14 p 0 045 conclusion fibrinolytic shutdown especially persistence phenotype common traumatic pancreatic injury phys hf related mortality risk factor including ly30 admission intra abdominal injury operative treatment associated persistent fibrinolytic shutdown sheltered patient risk factor seems beneficial need confirmed large scale study 2023 elsevier ltd,traumatic pancreatic injury; persistent fibrinolytic shutdown; intra abdominal injury; case enrolled aged; unknown traumatic pancreatic; screening traumatic pancreatic; common traumatic pancreatic; odds ratio aor; tsd cohort included; time maximal clot; shutdown tsd persistent; conclusion fibrinolytic shutdown; severity characteristic pancreatic; large scale study; admission intra abdominal; reduction clot strength; maximal clot strength; clot strength utilized; adjusted odds ratio; abdominal injury operative,screening traumatic pancreatic; patient determined thromboelastography; thromboelastography teg percentage; pancreatic injury patient; pancreatic injury phys,all right reserved; ;Fibrinolytic system;Modification;Relationship;Prognosis;Traumatic pancreatic injury;Prospective cohort research;Identify fibrinolytic characteristic;Patient pancreatic trauma;Identify correlation mortality,0.446886911383185,0.3868608760883372,0.29905154682282015

Adult male C. maculatus pass large ejaculates to mates while not feeding. Here, we studied ejaculate production and longevity in C. maculatus males at different temperatures and mating patterns. After development at 25, 27 and 29 °C, eclosing males were weighed and prevented from mating (m0) or allowed to mate once with virgin females three (m3) or five (m5) days after eclosion or to mate twice, three and five days after eclosion (m3+5). We weighed males before and after mating to estimate body mass loss due to ejaculate transfer and depletion of resources over time attributed to routine physiology/evaporation. Warmer conditions increased mortality and development rates and tended to decrease body mass. Males with a large body mass at eclosion survived longer than smaller males. The body mass of males was depleted at daily rates equal to 3–5% of body mass at eclosion. The rates of this loss increased in warmer conditions, suggesting that this process was the main determinant of the thermal pattern of mortality. During a single mating, males produced ejaculates that constituted 2–6% of their body mass at eclosion. Contrary to predictions, ejaculate production did not change with thermal conditions. Body mass losses through ejaculate transfer resulted in increased male mortality, and this effect was two times stronger than the effect of a comparable body mass loss through routine physiology/evaporation. Ejaculate mass decreased with age independent of mating history, suggesting that ejaculate production is restricted by routine physiology/evaporation losses. We conclude that the longevity of male C. maculatus is a function of body mass loss, but the two sources of body mass loss considered here, ejaculates and routine physiology, are not equally costly. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",Aphagia; Callosobruchus maculatus; Nuptial gift; Survival; Temperature,,temperature humidity determine seed viability effect seed pest reproduction bean beetle callosobruchus maculatus remains understudied adult male c maculatus pas large ejaculate mate feeding studied ejaculate production longevity c maculatus male different temperature mating pattern development 25 27 29 c eclosing male weighed prevented mating m0 allowed mate virgin female three m3 five m5 day eclosion mate twice three five day eclosion m3 5 weighed male mating estimate body mass loss due ejaculate transfer depletion resource time attributed routine physiology evaporation warmer condition increased mortality development rate tended decrease body mass male large body mass eclosion survived longer smaller male body mass male depleted daily rate equal 3 5 body mass eclosion rate loss increased warmer condition suggesting process main determinant thermal pattern mortality single mating male produced ejaculate constituted 2 6 body mass eclosion contrary prediction ejaculate production change thermal condition body mass loss ejaculate transfer resulted increased male mortality effect two time stronger effect comparable body mass loss routine physiology evaporation ejaculate mass decreased age independent mating history suggesting ejaculate production restricted routine physiology evaporation loss conclude longevity male c maculatus function body mass loss two source body mass loss considered ejaculate routine physiology equally costly 2023 elsevier ltd,body mass loss; body mass eclosion; routine physiology evaporation; body mass male; mass decreased age; estimate body mass; decrease body mass; comparable body mass; function body mass; source body mass; body mass; mass eclosion survived; mass eclosion contrary; physiology equally costly; condition body mass; mass loss routine; large body mass; physiology evaporation warmer; mass loss due; mass loss considered,pest reproduction bean; reproduction bean beetle; bean beetle callosobruchus; mortality single mating; male mating estimate,Temperature ;Humidity ;Seed viability ;Seed pest ;Reproduction ;Bean beetle ;Callosobruchus maculatus ;Adult male ;Mating ;Feeding ;E,0.0,0.0702073642908397,0.23027649811653178

It is an essential habitat for international migratory birds. The habitat of birds in this area changes rapidly. The ecological corridor is an important means to maintain the stability of the watershed ecosystem and enhance the ecological sustainability of the watershed. It has significant demonstration implications for the preservation of biodiversity and the restoration of ecological functions of wetlands with significant ecological value. In this study, the rare white-headed crane distributed in Chongming Dongtan was taken as the research object, and the land use change in Chongming Dongtan in recent ten years was obtained by ENVI and ArcGIS10.8 software. The ecological sources of the white-headed crane population were screened using morphological spatial pattern analysis (MSPA) and landscape connectivity. Using GIS technology to construct a comprehensive resistance surface, combined with circuit theory, the ecological processes in heterogeneous landscapes are simulated by calculating ' resistance ' or ' current ' to identify important ecological corridors, ecological pinch points, and ecological obstacles. The results showed that the region included 24 ecological sources, 46 ecological corridors, 127 ecological pinch points, and 134 Ecological obstacle points. The habitat in the study area showed a trend of fragmentation. The high-resistance areas of Chongming Dongtan were mainly distributed in low-altitude areas with rapid urbanization and frequent human activities, such as Qiyao Town and Yuxi Village. The ecological corridors of White-headed cranes are mainly distributed in bare flat, reed beaches, grassland, and paddy fields. The optimal threshold of MSPA landscape in the study area is 500 m. At the same time, the ecological function area is optimized and divided into different levels, such as ecological core area, ecological buffer zone, ecological crisscross area, production and living area. This study constructs the ecological corridor of the White-headed crane in Chongming Dongtan from the regional wetland scale, which is helpful to optimize the suitable habitat pattern, and provide the method basis for the habitat protection and ecological network construction of regional wetland habitat. © 2023 The Author(s)",Circuit theory; Ecological corridor; Ecological pinch point; MSPA; White-headed crane,Biodiversity; Birds; Ecosystems; Electric network analysis; Land use; Molluscs; Rivers; Timing circuits; Wetlands; Chongming; Circuits theory; Ecological corridor; Ecological functions; Ecological pinch point; Morphological spatial pattern analyse; Pinch points; Spatial pattern analysis; Study areas; White-headed crane; Watersheds; bird; estuarine environment; GIS; habitat corridor; habitat fragmentation; land use change; theoretical study; wetland; China; Chongming Island; Dongtan; Shanghai,yangtze river estuary chongming dongtan international important wetland typical estuary wetland essential habitat international migratory bird habitat bird area change rapidly ecological corridor important mean maintain stability watershed ecosystem enhance ecological sustainability watershed significant demonstration implication preservation biodiversity restoration ecological function wetland significant ecological value study rare white headed crane distributed chongming dongtan taken research object land use change chongming dongtan recent ten year obtained envi arcgis10 8 software ecological source white headed crane population screened using morphological spatial pattern analysis mspa landscape connectivity using gi technology construct comprehensive resistance surface combined circuit theory ecological process heterogeneous landscape simulated calculating resistance current identify important ecological corridor ecological pinch point ecological obstacle result showed region included 24 ecological source 46 ecological corridor 127 ecological pinch point 134 ecological obstacle point habitat study area showed trend fragmentation high resistance area chongming dongtan mainly distributed low altitude area rapid urbanization frequent human activity qiyao town yuxi village ecological corridor white headed crane mainly distributed bare flat reed beach grassland paddy field optimal threshold mspa landscape study area 500 time ecological function area optimized divided different level ecological core area ecological buffer zone ecological crisscross area production living area study construct ecological corridor white headed crane chongming dongtan regional wetland scale helpful optimize suitable habitat pattern provide method basis habitat protection ecological network construction regional wetland habitat 2023 author,white headed crane; corridor white headed; ecological corridor white; headed crane chongming; ecological pinch point; source white headed; headed crane distributed; rare white headed; crane chongming dongtan; headed crane population; chongming dongtan regional; distributed chongming dongtan; crane distributed chongming; chongming dongtan international; estuary chongming dongtan; chongming dongtan recent; area chongming dongtan; corridor ecological pinch; dongtan regional wetland; study rare white,arcgis10 software ecological; biodiversity restoration ecological; international important wetland; wetland significant ecological; ecological sustainability watershed,Yangtze River; Estuary; Chongming Dongtan; International; Important; Wetland; Typical; Essential; Habitat; International Migratory Bird; Area; Change; Rapidly; Ecological Corridor; Maintain Stability; Watershed; Ecosystem; Enhance; Ecological,0.4784248883073711,0.3961207521315574,0.2554845474892622

Social mate choice is studied less often than reproductive mate choice, but for species that exhibit biparental care, choice of a social mate may have important implications for offspring survival and success. Many species make pairing decisions based on size that can lead to population-scale pairing patterns such as assortative and disassortative mating by size. Other size-based pairing patterns, such as females pairing with males larger than themselves, have been commonly studied in humans, but less often studied in nonhuman animal systems. Here we show that sexually size-dimorphic mountain chickadees, Poecile gambeli, appear to exhibit multiple self-referential pairing patterns when choosing a social mate. Females paired with males that were larger than themselves more often than expected by chance, and they paired with males that were slightly larger than themselves more often than they paired with males that were much larger than themselves. Preference for slightly larger males versus much larger males did not appear to be driven by reproductive benefits as there were no statistically significant differences in reproductive performance between pairs in which males were slightly larger and pairs in which males were much larger than females. Our results indicate that self-referential pairing beyond positive and negative assortment may be common in nonhuman animal systems. © 2023 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour",chickadee; self-referential pairing; sexual size dimorphism; sexual size preference; social mate choice,evolutionary biology; female behavior; male; mate choice; pair bond; parental care; sexual dimorphism; social behavior; songbird; survival,mate choice key driver evolutionary phenomenon sexual dimorphism social mate choice studied le often reproductive mate choice specie exhibit biparental care choice social mate may important implication offspring survival success many specie make pairing decision based size lead population scale pairing pattern assortative disassortative mating size size based pairing pattern female pairing male larger commonly studied human le often studied nonhuman animal system show sexually size dimorphic mountain chickadee poecile gambeli appear exhibit multiple self referential pairing pattern choosing social mate female paired male larger often expected chance paired male slightly larger often paired male much larger preference slightly larger male versus much larger male appear driven reproductive benefit statistically significant difference reproductive performance pair male slightly larger pair male much larger female result indicate self referential pairing beyond positive negative assortment may common nonhuman animal system 2023 association study animal behaviour,nonhuman animal system; male slightly larger; association study animal; study animal behaviour; paired male slightly; slightly larger pair; pair male slightly; larger preference slightly; preference slightly larger; dimorphism social mate; choosing social mate; pattern choosing social; animal system show; common nonhuman animal; slightly larger male; sexual dimorphism social; pattern assortative disassortative; expected chance paired; system show sexually; key driver evolutionary,mate choice specie; reproductive mate choice; reproductive benefit statistically; female pairing male; pattern female pairing,Mate Choice;Evolutionary Phenomenon;Sexual Dimorphism;Social Mate Choice;Reproductive Mate Choice;Biparental Care;Offspring Survival;SizeBased Pairing Pattern;Assortative Mating;Disass,0.1806753442602243,0.2642873955094554,0.4311319531912785

Aggressivity is a character to dominate, protect position, and fight over resources. Several aggressive behaviours in humans are, for example, anger, hostility, physical aggression, and verbal aggression. Previous studies in western society showed that aggressivity could be perceived from the faces. We tested 100 Indonesian males ranging from 19-51 years old to fill out the Buss-Perry Aggression Questionnaire (BPAQ) to measure the aggression scale. The mean of their BPAQ scales (total aggression, anger, hostility, physical aggression, and verbal aggression) were 72.44±10.84, 17.37±3.97, 21.38±4.53, 18.97±4.65, 14.72±2.68, respectively. The average facial photograph was generated based on the min-Q1 (Low Aggressivity (LA)) and Q3-max (High Aggressivity (HA)) BPAQ scale. Next, the aggressivity of averaged LA and HA faces was evaluated by raters. The raters consisted of 145 males and 213 females randomly recruited, ranging from 17 to 67 years old. The facial width-to-height (fWHR) ratio between the average faces of the Low-Aggression face and the High-Aggression face was insignificant. This study concluded that Indonesian people could not perceive aggressivity in their faces. © 2023, Bogor Agricultural University.

Soc. 335 (1993), pp. 775-790], on whether the power Gω of a countably compact minimal Abelian group G is minimal, by showing that the negative answer is equivalent to the existence of measurable cardinals. The proof is carried out in the larger class of sequentially complete groups. We characterize the sequentially complete minimal Abelian groups G such that Gω is minimal – these are exactly those G that contain the connected component of their completion. This naturally leads to the next step, namely, a better understanding of the structure of the sequentially complete minimal Abelian groups, and in particular, their connected components which turns out to depend on the existence of Ulam measurable cardinals. More specifically, all connected sequentially complete minimal Abelian groups are compact if Ulam measurable cardinals do not exist. On the other hand, for every Ulam measurable cardinal σ we build a non-compact torsion-free connected minimal ω-bounded Abelian group of weight σ, thereby showing that the Ulam measurable cardinals are precisely the weights of non-compact sequentially complete connected minimal Abelian groups. © 2023 American Mathematical Society.",compact group; connected group; countably compact group; measurable cardinal; Minimal group; precompact group; sequentially complete group; totally disconnected group; ω-bounded group,,answer question raised thirty year ago dikranjan shakhmatov comp rend acad sci bulg 41 1990 pp 13 15 dikranjan shakhmatov trans amer math soc 335 1993 pp 775 790 whether power gω countably compact minimal abelian group g minimal showing negative answer equivalent existence measurable cardinal proof carried larger class sequentially complete group characterize sequentially complete minimal abelian group g gω minimal exactly g contain connected component completion naturally lead next step namely better understanding structure sequentially complete minimal abelian group particular connected component turn depend existence ulam measurable cardinal specifically connected sequentially complete minimal abelian group compact ulam measurable cardinal exist hand every ulam measurable cardinal σ build non compact torsion free connected minimal ω bounded abelian group weight σ thereby showing ulam measurable cardinal precisely weight non compact sequentially complete connected minimal abelian group 2023 american mathematical society,minimal abelian group; complete minimal abelian; ulam measurable cardinal; sequentially complete minimal; bounded abelian group; measurable cardinal proof; measurable cardinal specifically; measurable cardinal exist; measurable cardinal precisely; american mathematical society; abelian group weight; equivalent existence measurable; existence ulam measurable; showing ulam measurable; existence measurable cardinal; class sequentially complete; characterize sequentially complete; structure sequentially complete; abelian group compact; complete group characterize,raised thirty year; abelian group 2023; 2023 american mathematical; question raised thirty; math soc 335,Power of gω ;Countably Compact ;Minimal Abelian Group ;Negative Answer ;Measurable Cardinal ;Sequentially Complete Group ;Characterize Sequentially Complete ;Connected Component ;Completion,0.4579161279461449,0.1663731295422214,0.5638260590624516

However, we find several controversies in this field, like the Abraham-Minkowski controversy, or the attribution of angular momentum to quasi-static fields. In the present work we show that besides the electromagnetic momentum density proportional to Poynting's vector, whose time derivative is force and therefore can produce a torque, there are other momentum densities implied by the macroscopic Maxwell equations transformed into momentum balance equations. These momentum densities are also related to forces and torques. We show in this way that torques like D × E and B × H appear in these balance equations transformed into balance equations of angular momentum. The density D × E was used by Beth [Phys. Rev. 50 115–125 (1936)] to measure the angular momentum of radiation fields in interaction with anisotropic dielectrics.

Aims: This study set out to examine whether cognitive and maths performance of children with high ADHD symptoms differs depending on the co-occurrence of movement difficulties given evidence that weaker visuospatial processing, known to be important for maths performance, differentiates ADHD and DCD. We also aimed to examine whether relationships between cognition and maths in ADHD differs depending on co-occurring movement difficulties. Methods: Participants were 43 drug naïve children between 6 and 12 years old (M = 101.53 months SD = 19.58). The ADHD-only group (n = 18) included children with high ADHD scores, and those in the ADHD+DCD group (n = 25) concurrently had high movement difficulty scores. All completed executive function and memory, including 2 visuo-spatial memory tasks from the CANTAB battery and Mathematics Problem Solving, Numeracy, and Maths Fluency tasks from the WIAT-III and specific factual, conceptual, and procedural maths component tasks. Results: Children in the ADHD+DCD group scored significantly lower on visuospatial working memory (WM) capacity, than those in the ADHD-only group. Both groups were comparable on all other cognitive assessments of executive functions, memory, and processing speed. The groups did not differ in their maths attainment scores, nor on more specific maths skills. Comparison of the correlations between cognitive processes and maths revealed that the association between visuospatial WM updating and procedural skill efficiency was stronger for the ADHD-only group. Moreover, associations between visuospatial WM and maths problem solving attainment were stronger in the ADHD+DCD group. Conclusions: Despite similarities in maths performance, children with ADHD+DCD could be distinguished by lower visuospatial WM. Differential associations with some of the maths domain implicate recruitment of different cognitive processes for some aspects of maths. This distinction can be particularly useful for conceptualising cognitive characteristics of different clinical groups and understanding cognitive pathways of maths difficulties.

Aims: In the present study, we tested whether WISC-IV cognitive profiles can be useful to single out DD. Methods and procedures: Using a stringent 2-SD cutoff in a standardized numeracy battery, we identified children with DD (N = 43) within a clinical sample referred for assessment of learning disability and compared them in terms of WISC cognitive indexes to the remaining children without DD (N = 100) employing cross-validated logistic regression. Outcomes and results: Both groups showed higher Verbal Comprehension and Perceptual Reasoning than Working Memory and Processing Speed, and DD scores were generally lower. Predictive accuracy of WISC indexes in identifying DD individuals was low (AUC = 0.67) and it dropped to chance level in discriminating DD from selected controls (N = 43) with average math performance but matched on global IQ. The inclusion of a visuospatial memory score as an additional predictor did not improve classification accuracy.
