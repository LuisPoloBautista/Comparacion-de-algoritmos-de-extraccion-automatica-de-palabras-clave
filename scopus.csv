WRF-Chem simulations on 2017 showed that based on the six-city average, the aerosol load (PM2.5 concentrations) of 121.9, 49.6, 43.3, and 66.3 µg/m3 in January, April, July, and October, mainly lowered the level of downward shortwave radiation by 38.9, 24.0, 59.1, and 24.4 W/m2 and reduced the boundary layer height by 79.9, 40.8, 87.4, and 31.0 m, via scattering and absorbing solar radiation. The sensitivity of meteorological changes to identical aerosol loads varied in the order July &gt; January &gt; October and April. Then, the cooling and stabilizing effects of aerosols further led to increases in PM2.5, by 23.0, 3.4, 4.6, and 7.3 µg/m3 respectively in the four months. The sensitivity of the effect of aerosols on PM2.5 was greatest in January rather than in July, contrary to the effect on meteorology. Moreover, a negative linear relation was observed between daily BLH reductions and aerosol loads in fall and winter, and between PM2.5 increases and aerosol loads in all seasons. With the PM2.5 pollution improvements in this region, the aerosol radiative forcing was effectively reduced. This should result in daily BLH increases of 10–24 m in fall and winter, and the estimates in Beijing agreed well with the corresponding results based on AMDAR data. Additionally, the reduction in aerosol radiation effects brought about daily PM2.5 decreases of 1.6-2.8 µg/m3, accounting for 7.0%–17.7% in PM2.5 improvements. © 2022","Aerosol; Boundary layer height (BLH); North China; PM2.5; Radiative forcing","Atmospheric radiation; Boundary layer flow; Boundary layers; Radiation effects; Aerosol-radiation interactions; Boundary layer height; Boundary layer heights; Cooling effects; North China; PM 2.5; Radiative forcings; Short-wave radiation; Stabilizing effects; WRF/Chem; Aerosols; aerosol; aerosol composition; boundary layer; computer simulation; concentration (composition); numerical model; radiative forcing; shortwave radiation; solar radiation; China"

However, exact results in this context are available in only very few cases. In this work, we present the proof of the quasiparticle picture for the dynamics of entanglement entropies for two disjoint blocks in the XY chain after a quantum quench. As a byproduct, we also prove the quasiparticle conjecture for the mutual information in that model. Our calculations generalize those presented in Fagotti and Calabrese (2008 Phys. Rev. A 78 010306) to the case where the correlation matrix is a block-Toeplitz matrix, and rely on the multidimensional stationary phase approximation in the scaling limit. We also test the quasiparticle predictions against exact numerical calculations, and find excellent agreement. In the case of three blocks, we show that the tripartite information vanishes when at least two blocks are adjacent. © 2023 The Author(s).

METHODS: An electronic search was conducted in databases including PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, the Cochrane Library, and CNKI from their inception to January 2022. We calculated the odds ratio (OR) and mean difference (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) to assess the effect of DAA compared to PLA for the management of total hip arthroplasty (THA) in elderly patients using the dichotomous or continuous method with a random or fixed-effect model. RESULTS: 15 studies involving 1284 patients were included; 640 patients receiving DAA and 644 patients receiving PLA. DAA had a longer surgery duration than PLA [WMD = 9.41, 95% CI (4.64, 14.19), I2=95.5%]; The amount of postoperative drainage [WMD= -3.88, 95% CI (-5.59, -2.17), I2=98.3%], length of incision [WMD= -3.88, 95% CI (-5.59, -2.17), I2=98.3%], blood loss [WMD= -3.88, 95% CI (-5.59, -2.17), I2=98.3%], hospitalization time [WMD= -3.88, 95% CI (-5.59, -2.17), I2=98.3%], and postoperative bedtime [WMD = -5.56,95% CI (-7.11, -4.01), I2=99.0%], were similar between the two groups (p < 0.05). The HHS at 1 month, 12 months postoperatively [WMD = 7.58, 95%CI (5.70,9.46), I2=89.5%; WMD= 2.56, 95%CI 0.11,5.00, I2=93.2%] and the incidence of LFCN in patients were higher in the DAA group (OR = 2.91, 95% CI 1.26 to 6.71, I2=0.0%), while fewer patients in the DAA group suffered from postoperative dislocation than in the PLA group (OR = 0.26, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.60, I2=0.0%). No significant difference was observed in HHS at 1 week, 3 months, and 6 months postoperatively, VAS postoperatively at each time point, acetabular anteversion angle, acetabular abduction angle, wound infection, deep vein thrombosis, and intraoperative fracture (p > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: DAA offers a quicker functional recovery and is less invasive with an earlier return to daily activities in older THA patients than PLA. However, DAA was found to be associated with a high incidence of lateral femoral cutaneous nerve injury and a low incidence of postoperative dislocation.Key messagesThe present study aims to evaluate the clinical outcomes in elderly patients receiving DAA versus PLA for THA in the treatment of femoral neck fractures by mate-analysis.DAA offers a quicker functional recovery and is less invasive with an earlier return to daily activities in older THA patients.

Numerous studies have shown that butyrate has demonstrated promise as an antitumor agent in a variety of human cancer types. However, butyrate remains understudied in CRC tumorigenesis and progression. In this study, we explored therapeutic strategies to treat CRC by examining the role of butyrate metabolism. First, from the Molecular Signature Database (MSigDB), we identified 348 butyrate metabolism-related genes (BMRGs). Next, we downloaded 473 CRC and 41 standard colorectal tissue samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database and the transcriptome data of GSE39582 dataset from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. Then we evaluated the expression patterns of butyrate metabolism-related genes with difference analysis in CRC. Through univariate Cox regression and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) analysis, a prognostic model was constructed based on differentially expressed BMRGs. In addition, we discovered an independent prognostic marker for CRC patients. According to the expression levels and coefficients of identified BMRGs, the risk scores of all CRC samples were calculated. Utilizing differentially expressed genes in the high- and low-risk groups, we also constructed a Protein–Protein Interaction (PPI) network to visualize the interactions between proteins. Through the results of PPI network, we screened out differentially expressed target butyrate metabolism-related genes from ten hub genes. Finally, we performed clinical correlation analysis, immune cell infiltration analysis, and mutation analysis for these target genes. One hundred and seventy three differentially expressed butyrate metabolism-related genes were screened out in all the CRC samples. The prognostic model was established with univariate Cox regression and LASSO regression analysis. CRC patients’ overall survival was significantly lower in the high-risk group than in the low-risk group for both training and validation set. Among the ten hub genes identified from the PPI network, four target butyrate metabolism-related genes were identified containing FN1, SERPINE1, THBS2, and COMP, which might provide novel markers or targets for treating CRC patients. Eighteen butyrate metabolism-related genes were used to develop a risk prognostic model that could be helpful for doctors to predict CRC patients’ survival rate. Using this model, it is beneficial to forecast the response of CRC patients to immunotherapy and chemotherapy, thus making it easier to custom tailor cancer chemotherapy and immunotherapy to the individual patient. © 2023, The Author(s).",,"butyric acid derivative; carcinogenesis; colorectal tumor; genetics; human; immunotherapy; regulator gene; Butyrates; Carcinogenesis; Colorectal Neoplasms; Genes, Regulator; Humans; Immunotherapy"

However, long-term impact of prekindergarten programs is not well-understood and recent studies have shown preschool effectiveness can vary across states and programs. A state run prekindergarten program in New Mexico was examined using propensity score matching to minimize selection bias. The research revealed a number of long-term impacts corresponding with prekindergarten participation for the cohort including a 9.7 percentage point increase in high school graduation rates and improved reading and math proficiency at third, sixth, and eighth grades.

The most widely accepted explanation for why this underperformance occurs is that math-anxious people experience heightened anxiety when faced with math, and this in-the-moment anxiety interferes with performance. Surprisingly, this explanation has not been tested directly. Here, using both self-report and physiological indices of anxiety, we directly test how much in-the-moment anxiety explains math-anxious underperformance. Results indicate that in-the-moment anxiety indeed explains why math-anxious people underperform—but only partially, suggesting a need to seriously consider alternative mechanisms. Results also showed that while some highly math-anxious individuals—those with high levels of heart rate variability—experienced less in-the-moment anxiety, they nevertheless performed no better at math. For these individuals, math-anxious underperformance must occur for reasons unrelated to in-the-moment anxiety. More broadly, our findings point to substantial individual heterogeneity in the mechanisms underlying math-anxious underperformance. Accounting for this mechanistic heterogeneity may prove vital for optimally boosting math performance in math-anxious individuals. © 2023, The Author(s).",,

When chronological age is not available, age estimation is required, particularly in court cases. The mineralization chronology of permanent teeth is a valuable tool for age estimation of subadults. This study aimed to evaluate the mineralization stages of permanent teeth of Brazilian subjects from imaging exams, using the classification by Moorrees et al. modified by the authors, to verify the existence of correlation between the chronology of mineralization stages and sex and to prepare numerical tables of the chronology of dental mineralization stages for Brazilian individuals. Methods: Digital panoramic radiographs of 1100 living Brazilian individuals of both sexes, aged between 2 and 25 years, born between 1990 and 2018, from the image bank of a Dental Radiographs and Documentations clinic located in the city of Araraquara, SP, Brazil. The images were evaluated according to the level of crown and root development and classified according to the stages proposed by Moorrees et al. (Am J Phys Anthropol 21: 205–213, 1963) adapted by the authors. All analyses were performed in the R software. Descriptive and exploratory analyses were performed on all data. For intra- and inter-examiner analyses, the rate of agreement and Kappa statistics at a 95% confidence interval were used. Kappa was interpreted according to Landis and Koch. Results: Only upper and lower canines showed significant differences between the sexes (p < 0.05), with higher average ages for men. The findings were presented in tables, as well as age estimates with 95% confidence intervals for each mineralization stage and each tooth. Conclusion: In the present study, we evaluated the mineralization stages of permanent teeth of Brazilian subjects from digital panoramic radiographs and found no correlation between the chronology of mineralization stages and sex, except for canines. From the obtained results, numerical tables of the chronology of dental mineralization stages were prepared. © 2023, The Author(s).","Age determination by teeth; Forensic anthropology; Forensic dentistry; Forensic sciences","animal; Brazil; dental age estimation; female; male; panoramic radiography; procedures; secondary dentition; tooth; Age Determination by Teeth; Animals; Brazil; Dentition, Permanent; Female; Male; Radiography, Panoramic; Tooth"

Males use depletable and costly urine marks in intrasexual competition and mate attraction. We investigate how males alter signaling decisions across variable social landscapes using thermal imaging to capture spatiotemporal marking data. Thermal recording reveals fine-scale adjustments in urinary motor patterns in response to competition and social odors. Males demonstrate striking winner-loser effects in scent mark allocation effort and timing. Competitive experience primes temporal features of marking and modulates responses to scent familiarity. Males adjust signaling effort, mark latency, and marking rhythm, depending on the scent identities in the environment. Notably, recent contest outcome affects how males respond to familiar and unfamiliar urine. Winners increase marking effort toward unfamiliar relative to familiar male scents, whereas losers reduce marking effort to unfamiliar but increase to familiar rival scents. All males adjust their scent mark timing after a contest regardless of fight outcome, and deposit marks in more rapid bursts during marking bouts. In contrast to this dynamism, initial signal investment predicts aspects of scent marking days later, revealing the possibility of alternative marking strategies among competitive males. These data show that mice flexibly update their signaling decisions in response to changing social landscapes. © 2023, The Author(s).",,"fragrance; pheromone; animal; animal behavior; male; mouse; physiology; social behavior; social environment; Animals; Behavior, Animal; Male; Mice; Odorants; Pheromones; Social Behavior; Social Environment"

The radiation-based sterile insect technique (SIT) has a limited effect on mosquito control because of the difficulty in irradiating males without reducing their mating competitiveness. In this study, the insect sex pheromone heptacosane was applied to Ae. aegypti males to investigate whether it could enhance the mating competitiveness of irradiated males. Methods: Heptacosane was smeared on the abdomens of Ae. aegypti males that were allowed to mate with untreated virgin females. The insemination rate was used to assess the attractiveness of heptacosane-treated males to females. The pupae were irradiated with different doses of X-rays and γ-rays, and the emergence, survival time, egg number, and hatch rate were detected to find the optimal dose of X-ray and γ-ray radiation. The males irradiated at the optimal dose were smeared with heptacosane, released in different ratios with untreated males, and mated with females. The effect of heptacosane on the mating competitiveness of irradiated mosquitoes was then evaluated by the hatch rate, induced sterility, and mating competitiveness index. Results: Applying heptacosane to Ae. aegypti males significantly increased the insemination rate of females by 20%. Pupal radiation did not affect egg number but significantly reduced survival time and hatch rate. The emergence of the pupae was not affected by X-ray radiation but was affected by γ-ray radiation. Pupae exposed to 60 Gy X-rays and 40 Gy γ-rays were selected for subsequent experiments. After 60 Gy X-ray irradiation or 40 Gy γ-ray irradiation, the average hatch rate was less than 0.1%, and the average survival time was more than 15 days. Moreover, at the same release ratio, the hatch rate of the irradiated group perfumed with heptacosane was lower than that of the group without heptacosane. Conversely, the male sterility and male mating competitiveness index were significantly increased due to the use of heptacosane. Conclusions: The sex pheromone heptacosane enhanced the interaction between Ae. aegypti males and females. Perfuming males irradiated by X-rays or γ-rays with heptacosane led to a significant increase in mating competitiveness. This study provided a new idea for improving the application effect of SIT.

The PISA assessment framework provides the backbone to the interpretation of the results of the PISA test scores. However, an identified gap in the current literature is whether mode effects have affected test score interpretation as defined by the assessment framework, and whether the interpretations of the PBA and CBA test scores are comparable. Methods: This study uses the 2015 PISA field trial data from thirteen countries to compare test modes through a construct representation approach. It is investigated whether item facets defined by the assessment framework (e.g., different cognitive demands) affect item difficulty comparably across modes using a unidimensional two-group generalized partial credit model (GPCM). Results: Linking the assessment framework to item difficulty using linear regression showed that for both maths and science domains, item categorisation relates to item difficulty, however for the reading domain no such conclusion was possible. In comparing PBA to CBA in representations across the three domains, maths had one facet with a significant difference in representation, reading had all three facets significantly different, and for science, four out of six facets had significant differences. Modelling items labelled “mode invariant” in PISA 2015, the results indicated that in every domain, two facets showed significant differences between the test modes. The graphical inspection of difficulty patterns confirmed that reading shows stronger differences while the patterns of the other domains were quite consistent between modes. Conclusions: The present study shows that the mode effects on difficulty vary within the task facets proposed by the PISA assessment framework, in particular for reading. These findings shed light on whether the comparability of score interpretation between modes is compromised. Given the limitations of the link between the reading domain and item difficulty, any conclusions in this domain are limited. Importantly, the present study adds a new approach and empirical findings to the investigation of the cross-mode equivalence in PISA domains. © 2023, The Author(s).","Assessment framework; Construct representation; Generalized partial credit model; Item facets; Mode effects; PISA",

Using data from the NEPS Newborn Cohort study, this paper focuses on 4 year-old children and the effects of the numerical and literacy stimulation during mother–child interactions they received at age 2. After controlling for different domain-specific stimulations, structural characteristics of the children’s home learning environment, parental views, important child characteristics, and general educational processes between mother and child, empirical analyses showed small but statistically significant gender differences in mathematical competencies favoring girls. Early domain-specific stimulation in mother–child interactions at age 2 did not offer a good explanation for this math advantage of girls over boys at age 4. Nonetheless, even when 2 year-old girls received numerical stimulation quite similar to that of boys, there was some evidence that girls received a higher input in terms of literacy stimulation, and this is related to the small advantage of girls in mathematical competencies at age 4. © 2023, The Author(s).","Domain-specific stimulation; Early mother–child interactions; Gender; Mathematical competencies",

A concept extensively studied in education is engagement, a multidimensional construct encompassing behavioral expression and motivational backgrounds. This metric can be used to not only guide certain pedagogic methodologies, but also to endow systems with the right tutoring techniques. As such, this article aims to inspire improved teaching styles and automatic learning systems, by experimentally verifying the influence of in-class behaviors in students’ engagement. Results: Over 16 math lessons, the occurrence of students’ and instructors’ behaviors, alongside students’ engagement estimates, were recorded using the COPUS observation protocol. After behavior-profiling the classes deploying such lessons, significant linear models were computed to relate the frequency of the students’ or instructors’ behaviors with the students’ engagement at different in-class periods. The models revealed a positive relation of students’ initial individual thinking and later group activity participation with their collective engagement, as well as a positive engagement relation with the later application of instructor’s strategies such as giving feedback and moving through class, guiding on-going work. Conclusions: The results suggest the benefit of applying a workshop-like learning process, providing more individual explanations and feedback at the beginning of an interaction, leaving collective feedback and students’ guidance of on-going work for later on. Based on the relations suggested by our models, several guidelines for developing ALSs are proposed, and a practical illustrative example is formulated. © 2023, The Author(s).","Adaptive Learning Systems; Behavioral engagement; COPUS Protocol; STEM Education",

P-15 peptides could bind to integrin receptors on various precursor cells, promote cell adhesion, release growth factors, and promote the differentiation of osteoblast precursor cells. However, the role of P-15 in OA, particularly in chondrocyte proliferation, is not fully understood. Methods: The activity of SFPQ and RUNX2 in the bone tissue of patients with osteoarthritis was analyzed using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Interleukin-1β (IL-1β) inducer was performed to establish an in vitro model of OA. Cell proliferation was measured by CCK-8 assay. The expressions of COL2a1, ACAN, COMP, SOX9, and BMP2 related to cartilage differentiation were detected using qRT-PCR. In addition, the expression levels of SFPQ, AKT, p-AKT, and RUNX2 were detected using Western blotting. Results: The results showed that the expression of SFPQ was significantly decreased and the expression of RUNX2 was significantly increased in osteoarthritis cartilage tissue. P-15 peptide reversed IL-1β-induced cell proliferation obstruction and alleviated chondrocyte damage. Furthermore, P-15 polypeptide increased the expression levels of cartilage differentiation genes COL2a1, ACAN, and BMP2, while decreasing the expression of COMP and SOX9 in an inverse dose-dependent manner. Then specific interfering RNA proved that P-15 maintains chondrocyte stability and is associated with the SFPQ gene. Finally, we confirmed that P-15 inhibited the Akt-RUNX2 pathway, which is regulated in the expression of SFPQ. Conclusions: P-15 can mitigate chondrocyte damage and osteoarthritis progression by inhibiting cell death and modulating SFPQ-Akt-RUNX2 pathway, offering an opportunity to develop new strategies for the treatment of osteoarthritis. © 2023, The Author(s).","Akt-RUNX2 axis; Chondrocytes; P-15 peptide; Proliferation; SFPQ","interleukin 1beta; protein kinase B; RUNX2 protein, human; transcription factor RUNX2; apoptosis; cell proliferation; chondrocyte; genetics; human; metabolism; osteoarthritis; Apoptosis; Cell Proliferation; Chondrocytes; Core Binding Factor Alpha 1 Subunit; Humans; Interleukin-1beta; Osteoarthritis; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt"

However, no unified characterization of blended Math-Sci sensemaking exists. Results: We developed a theoretical cognitive model for blended Math-Sci sensemaking grounded in prior work. The model contains three broad levels representing increasingly sophisticated ways of engaging in blended Math-Sci sensemaking: (1) developing qualitative relationships among relevant variables in mathematical equations describing a phenomenon (“qualitative level”); (2) developing mathematical relationships among these variables (“quantitative level”); and (3) explaining how the mathematical operations used in the formula relate to the phenomenon (“conceptual level”). Each level contains three sublevels. We used PhET simulations to design dynamic assessment scenarios in various disciplines to test the model. We used these assessments to interview undergraduate students with a wide range of Math skills. Interview analysis provided validity evidence for the categories and preliminary evidence for the ordering of the categories comprising the cognitive model. It also revealed that students tend to perform at the same level across different disciplinary contexts, suggesting that blended Math-Sci sensemaking is a distinct cognitive construct, independent of specific disciplinary context. Conclusion: This paper presents a first-ever published validated cognitive model describing proficiency in blended Math-Sci sensemaking which can guide instruction, curriculum, and assessment development. © 2023, The Author(s).","Blended sensemaking; Cognitive framework; Math sensemaking; Science sensemaking; Validity",

Both neurofibromin 1 and cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP) play a role in the development of the skeleton. Carrying both germline mutations has not been previously reported; however, it can affect the developing phenotype. Case presentation: The index patient, an 8-year-old female presented with several skeletal and dermatologic anomalies resembling the coexistence of multiple syndromes. Her mother had dermatologic symptoms characteristic for neurofibromatosis type 1, and her father presented with distinct skeletal anomalies. NGS-based analysis revealed a heterozygous pathogenic mutation in genes NF1 and COMP in the index patient. A previously unreported heterozygous variant was detected for the NF1 gene. The sequencing of the COMP gene revealed a previously reported, pathogenic heterozygous variant that is responsible for the development of the pseudoachondroplasia phenotype. Conclusions: Here, we present the case of a young female carrying pathogenic NF1 and COMP mutations, diagnosed with two distinct heritable disorders, neurofibromatosis type 1 and pseudoachondroplasia. The coincidence of two monogenic autosomal dominant disorders is rare and can pose a differential diagnostic challenge. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported co-occurrence of these syndromes. © 2023, The Author(s).","Cartilage oligomeric matrix protein; Case report; Neurofibromatosis 1; Neurofibromin 1; Pseudoachondroplasia","cartilage oligomeric matrix protein; neurofibromin; Article; autosomal dominant disorder; bone disease; bone malformation; case report; child; clinical article; clinical feature; comorbidity; COMP gene; family history; father; female; genotype phenotype correlation; germline mutation; heterozygote; high throughput sequencing; human; molecular pathology; mother; neurofibromatosis type 1; NF1 gene; pseudoachondroplasia; Sanger sequencing; school child; skin disease; achondroplasia; complication; genetics; mutation; neurofibromatosis type 1; phenotype; Achondroplasia; Female; Humans; Mutation; Neurofibromatosis 1; Phenotype"

To quantify how well an inferred graph can explain a trace, we introduce feasibility, a novel quality criterion, and suggest that it is linked to the result’s accuracy. In addition, we propose CEM-*, a network inference method that guarantees 100% feasibility given online social media traces, which are a non-trivial extension of the Expectation-Maximization algorithm developed by Newman (Nature Phys 14:67–75, 2018). We propose a set of linear optimization updates that incorporate a set of auxiliary variables and a set of feasibility constraints; the latter takes into consideration all the hidden paths that are possible between users based on their timestamps of interaction and guides the inference toward feasibility. We provide two CEM-* variations, that assume either an Erdős–Rényi (ER) or a Stochastic Block Model (SBM) prior for the underlying graph’s unknown distribution. Extensive experiments on one synthetic and one real-world Twitter dataset show that for both priors CEM-* can generate a posterior distribution of graphs that explains the whole trace while being closer to the ground truth. As an additional benefit, the use of the SBM prior infers and clusters users simultaneously during optimization. CEM-* outperforms baseline and state-of-the-art methods in terms of feasibility, run-time, and precision of the inferred graph and communities. Finally, we propose a heuristic to adapt the inference to lower feasibility requirements and show how it can affect the precision of the result. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.","Expectation maximization; Network inference; Network reconstruction; Online social networks; Stochastic block model","Computational electromagnetics; Graphic methods; Image segmentation; Inference engines; Linear programming; Maximum principle; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; 'current; Expectation Maximization; Inference algorithm; Network inference; Network reconstruction; Online users; Quality criteria; Social graphs; Stochastic block models; User interaction; Social networking (online)"

Many species within clades of vertebrates are known to fluoresce including mammals, reptiles, birds, and fish. Most, if not all, amphibians exhibit biofluorescence when exposed to either blue (440–460 nm) or ultra-violet (360–380 nm) wavelengths of light. Salamanders (Lissamphibia: Caudata) appear to consistently fluoresce in green wavelengths (520–560 nm) when excited by blue light. Biofluorescence is theorized to have many ecological functions including mate signaling, camouflage, and mimicry. Despite the discovery of their biofluorescence, its role in salamander ecology and behavior remains unresolved. In this study we present the first case of biofluorescent sexual dimorphism within Amphibia and the first documentation of the biofluorescent pattern of a salamander within the Plethodon jordani species complex. This sexually dimorphic trait was discovered in the southern Appalachian endemic species, Southern Gray-Cheeked Salamander (Plethodon metcalfi, Brimley in Proc Biol Soc Wash 25:135–140, 1912), and may extend into other species within the Plethodon jordani and Plethodon glutinosus species complexes. We propose that this sexually dimorphic trait could be related to fluorescence of ventral modified granular glands used in plethodontid chemosensory communication. © 2023, The Author(s).",,"Amphibia; animal experiment; article; blue light; documentation; ecology; endemic species; fluorescence; nonhuman; Plethodon; salamander; sex difference; signal transduction; species complex; animal; Caelifera; case report; Caudata; cheek; interpersonal communication; mammal; sexual characteristics; United States; Animals; Appalachian Region; Cheek; Communication; Grasshoppers; Mammals; Sex Characteristics; Urodela"

One popular hypothesis is that this may be due to a lack of early binaural experience. However, we have recently shown that neonatally deafened rats fitted with biCIs in adulthood quickly learn to discriminate ITDs as well as their normal hearing litter mates, and perform an order of magnitude better than human biCI users. Our unique behaving biCI rat model allows us to investigate other possible limiting factors of prosthetic binaural hearing, such as the effect of stimulus pulse rate and envelope shape. Previous work has indicated that ITD sensitivity may decline substantially at the high pulse rates often used in clinical practice. We therefore measured behavioral ITD thresholds in neonatally deafened, adult implanted biCI rats to pulse trains of 50, 300, 900 and 1800 pulses per second (pps), with either rectangular or Hanning window envelopes. Our rats exhibited very high sensitivity to ITDs at pulse rates up to 900 pps for both envelope shapes, similar to those in common clinical use. However, ITD sensitivity declined to near zero at 1800 pps, for both Hanning and rectangular windowed pulse trains. Current clinical cochlear implant (CI) processors are often set to pulse rates ≥ 900 pps, but ITD sensitivity in human CI listeners has been reported to decline sharply above ~ 300 pps. Our results suggest that the relatively poor ITD sensitivity seen at > 300 pps in human CI users may not reflect the hard upper limit of biCI ITD performance in the mammalian auditory pathway. Perhaps with training or better CI strategies good binaural hearing may be achievable at pulse rates high enough to allow good sampling of speech envelopes while delivering usable ITDs. © 2023, The Author(s).",,"adult; animal; auditory nervous system; cochlea prosthesis; cochlear implantation; heart rate; human; mammal; rat; tachycardia; Adult; Animals; Auditory Pathways; Cochlear Implantation; Cochlear Implants; Heart Rate; Humans; Mammals; Rats; Tachycardia"

The proposed velocity-temperature coupling control method (Liu et al, Phys Rev Fluids 6:044603, 2021) is further extended to the hypersonic turbulent boundary layer. Direct numerical simulation results of four comparative cases show that the heated wall blowing achieves a drag reduction rate of 10.58%, which is about the sum of wall blowing (5.27%) and wall heating (6.35%). By evaluating the control efficiency, however, it is found that heated wall blowing is not as good as wall blowing and cannot obtain net energy saving rate. The modified FIK decompositions of skin friction coefficient indicate that the cliffy decrease of the mean convection term is the primary contribution for the drag reduction. Effects of the proposed control measure on turbulence statistics and coherent structures are also analyzed. Streamwise vortex is found to be away from the wall, thus leading to a lower friction drag. © 2023, The Author(s).","Direct numerical simulations; Hypersonic turbulent boundary layer; Turbulence drag reduction; Turbulence statistics; Turbulence structures; Velocity-temperature coupled control","Atmospheric thermodynamics; Boundary layer flow; Direct numerical simulation; Drag reduction; Energy conservation; Friction; Hypersonic aerodynamics; Hypersonic boundary layers; Hypersonic flow; Numerical models; Turbulent flow; Coupled controls; Direct-numerical-simulation; Drag reduction mechanism; Heated wall; Hypersonic turbulent boundary layer; Turbulence drag reduction; Turbulence statistics; Turbulence structures; Turbulent boundary layers; Velocity-temperature coupled control; Turbulence"

However, we know little about how opportunity measures vary over time, and the extent to which such dynamics are affected by stochasticity. We use published mating data from multiple species to investigate temporal variation in the opportunity for sexual selection. First, we show that the opportunity for precopulatory sexual selection typically declines over successive days in both sexes and shorter sampling periods lead to substantial overestimates. Second, by utilising randomised null models, we also find that these dynamics are largely explained by an accumulation of random matings, but that intrasexual competition may slow temporal declines. Third, using data from a red junglefowl (Gallus gallus) population, we show that declines in precopulatory measures over a breeding period were mirrored by declines in the opportunity for both postcopulatory and total sexual selection. Collectively, we show that variance-based metrics of selection change rapidly, are highly sensitive to sampling durations, and likely lead to substantial misinterpretation if used as indicators of sexual selection. However, simulations can begin to disentangle stochastic variation from biological mechanisms. © 2023, The Author(s).",,"copulation; intrasexual interaction; mating behavior; reproductive success; sexual selection; temporal variation; article; breeding; competition; controlled study; female; Gallus gallus; male; mating; nonhuman; randomized controlled trial; sexual selection; simulation; stochastic model; animal; mate choice; reproduction; sexual behavior; Animals; Chickens; Female; Male; Mating Preference, Animal; Reproduction; Sexual Behavior, Animal; Sexual Selection"

However, the majority of work demonstrating links between sustained attention and academic skills has been conducted in lab-based settings that lack the ecological validity of a more naturalistic environment, like school. Further, most studies focus on targeted academic measures of specific sub-skills and have not fully examined whether this relationship generalizes to broad measures of academic achievement that are used for important, real-world, academic advancement decisions, such as standardized test scores. To address this gap, we examined the role of sustained attention in predicting targeted and broad assessments of academic abilities, where all skills were assessed in group-based environments in schools. In a sample of over 700 students aged 9–14, we showed that attention was positively related to performance on targeted assessments (math fluency and reading comprehension), as well as broad academic measures (statewide standardized test scores). Moreover, we found that attention was more predictive of targeted math sub-skills compared to assessments of broad math abilities, but was equally predictive of reading for both types of measures. Our findings add to our understanding of how sustained attention is linked to academic skills assessed in more ‘real-world’, naturalistic school environments and have important implications for designing tools to support student’s academic success. © 2023, The Author(s).",,"academic success; article; attention; child; female; human; human experiment; major clinical study; male; reading; school child; skill; academic success; attention; cognition; educational status; psychology; student; Academic Success; Attention; Child; Cognition; Educational Status; Humans; Reading; Students"

Both food insecurity and health outcomes are the policy and agenda of the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). However, there is a lack of macro-level empirical studies (Macro-level study means studies at the broadest level using variables that represent a given country or the whole population of a country or economy as a whole. For example, if the urban population (% of the total population) of XYZ country is 30%, it is used as a proxy variable to represent represent country's urbanization level. Empirical study implies studies that employ the econometrics method, which is the application of math and statistics.) concerning the relationship between food insecurity and health outcomes in sub-Saharan African (SSA) countries though the region is highly affected by food insecurity and its related health problems. Therefore, this study aims to examine the impact of food insecurity on life expectancy and infant mortality in SSA countries. Methods: The study was conducted for the whole population of 31 sampled SSA countries selected based on data availability. The study uses secondary data collected online from the databases of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO), and the World Bank (WB). The study uses yearly balanced data from 2001 to 2018. This study employs a multicountry panel data analysis and several estimation techniques; it employs Driscoll-Kraay standard errors (DKSE), a generalized method of momentum (GMM), fixed effects (FE), and the Granger causality test. Results: A 1% increment in people’s prevalence for undernourishment reduces their life expectancy by 0.00348 percentage points (PPs). However, life expectancy rises by 0.00317 PPs with every 1% increase in average dietary energy supply. A 1% rise in the prevalence of undernourishment increases infant mortality by 0.0119 PPs. However, a 1% increment in average dietary energy supply reduces infant mortality by 0.0139 PPs. Conclusions: Food insecurity harms the health status of SSA countries, but food security impacts in the reverse direction.

Here, we developed a mouse behavioral paradigm to test the role played by the novelty of the background odors. During the task, mice identified target odors in previously learned background odors and were challenged by catch trials with novel background odors, a task similar to visual CAPTCHA. Female wild-type (WT) mice could accurately identify known targets in novel background odors. WT mice performance was higher than linear classifiers and the nearest neighbor classifier trained using olfactory bulb glomerular activation patterns. Performance was more consistent with an odor deconvolution method. We also used our task to investigate the performance of female Cntnap2-/- mice, which show some autism-like behaviors. Cntnap2-/- mice had glomerular activation patterns similar to WT mice and matched WT mice target detection for known background odors. However, Cntnap2-/- mice performance fell almost to chance levels in the presence of novel backgrounds. Our findings suggest that mice use a robust algorithm for detecting odors in novel environments and this computation is impaired in Cntnap2-/- mice. © 2023, The Author(s).",,"deconvolution; identification method; odor; olfactory cue; rodent; CNTNAP2 protein, mouse; fragrance; membrane protein; nerve protein; animal; animal behavior; female; learning; mouse; odor; olfactory bulb; physiology; Animals; Behavior, Animal; Female; Learning; Membrane Proteins; Mice; Nerve Tissue Proteins; Odorants; Olfactory Bulb; Smell"

In this study, we examined flash signals and mate recognition in the Asian firefly, Aquatica lateralis, under natural field conditions. We found that the flash pattern of females changes after copulation, from simple short flashes to flashes with longer duration and flickering. To understand the functions of flickering, we video-recorded and analyzed the flashes of sedentary males, receptive females, and mated females. The results showed that the flashes of these three adult phases can be discriminated from each other by two parameters, flash duration and flicker intensity, with little overlap. Male attraction experiments using an artificial LED device termed ‘e-firefly’ confirmed that flying and sedentary males are attracted to flashes with shorter durations and lower flicker intensities. The range of attraction success was much wider for flying males and narrower for sedentary males, and the latter was close to the range of receptive female’s flashes. These findings suggest that in addition to flash duration, flicker intensity is a flash signal parameter of mate recognition in A. lateralis males. © 2023, The Author(s).",,"adult; article; copulation; female; field study; firefly; flying; male; nonhuman; videorecording; animal; reproduction; time factor; Animals; Female; Fireflies; Male; Reproduction; Time Factors"

In this work, we apply a latent regression model to analyse the relationship between latent constructs (i.e., performance, speed, and exploration behaviour) and contextual variables among Scandinavian students (i.e., Norway, Sweden, and Denmark) during their completion of three interactive mathematics tasks in the 2012 Program for International Student Assessment (PISA). The purpose of this study is threefold: (1) to investigate whether a factor model is adequate for explaining the relationship between extracted process indicators from log files and students’ performance on the three items; (2) to evaluate whether measurement invariance holds for the three analysed countries; and (3) to determine how well contextual variables [i.e., a student’s background, availability, use of information and communication technology (ICT) resources, and learning conditions for mathematical literacy] correlate with the model’s latent constructs. Our findings reveal that a three-factor CFA model is well-suited to the analysed data and that a weak measurement invariance model performs best. By including contextual variables in the modelling, we also highlight the differences in Scandinavian students’ profiles. Specifically, higher economic social cultural status (ESCS) consistently led to higher math proficiency across all three countries. Norway did not show any gender differences in math proficiency, response time, or exploration behaviours. Experience with math tasks at school led to more exploration behaviours across all three countries. Swedish and Norwegian students who had more experience with pure math tasks at school were likely to obtain higher mathematics achievement scores and tended to interact more frequently with the testing platform when answering the three math items. When Danish students had higher ICT scores (i.e., more ICT resources available at school and home), they had lower response accuracy. There was, however, no effect of ICT on the three factors among Swedish and Norwegian students. Finally, we also discuss the implications and limitations of this study. © 2023, The Author(s).","Computer-based assessment; ILSA; Measurement invariance; Process data; Scandinavian",

Biomedical named entity recognition (BioNER) is one of the key and fundamental tasks in biomedical text mining. It also acts as a primitive step for many downstream applications such as relation extraction and knowledge base completion. Therefore, the accurate identification of entities in biomedical literature has certain research value. However, this task is challenging due to the insufficiency of sequence labeling and the lack of large-scale labeled training data and domain knowledge. Results: In this paper, we use a novel word-pair classification method, design a simple attention mechanism and propose a novel architecture to solve the research difficulties of BioNER more efficiently without leveraging any external knowledge. Specifically, we break down the limitations of sequence labeling-based approaches by predicting the relationship between word pairs. Based on this, we enhance the pre-trained model BioBERT, through the proposed prefix and attention map dscrimination fusion guided attention and propose the E-BioBERT. Our proposed attention differentiates the distribution of different heads in different layers in the BioBERT, which enriches the diversity of self-attention. Our model is superior to state-of-the-art compared models on five available datasets: BC4CHEMD, BC2GM, BC5CDR-Disease, BC5CDR-Chem, and NCBI-Disease, achieving F1-score of 92.55%, 85.45%, 87.53%, 94.16% and 90.55%, respectively. Conclusion: Compared with many previous various models, our method does not require additional training datasets, external knowledge, and complex training process. The experimental results on five BioNER benchmark datasets demonstrate that our model is better at mining semantic information, alleviating the problem of label inconsistency, and has higher entity recognition ability. More importantly, we analyze and demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed attention. © 2023, The Author(s).","Biomedical named entity recognition; E-BioBERT; PAMDFGA; Word-pair relation classification","Character recognition; Data mining; Knowledge management; Natural language processing systems; Semantics; Text processing; Biomedical literature; Biomedical named entity recognition; Biomedical text minings; E-BioBERT; External knowledge; PAMDFGA; Relation classifications; Sequence Labeling; Word-pair relation classification; Word-pairs; Domain Knowledge; benchmarking; data mining; knowledge base; procedures; semantics; Benchmarking; Data Mining; Knowledge Bases; Semantics"

However, the sub-lethal effects of baculoviruses are also highly debilitating for the host. The objective of the study was to demonstrate the sub-lethal effects of an indigenous strain of Spodoptera frugiperda nucleopolyhedrovirus (SpfrNPV) infecting fall armyworm in India. Results: As a result of larval infection, the larval developmental time was significantly prolonged as compared to the untreated insects. The percentage of pupal mortality ranged from 40.74 to 72.73 at varying doses of SpfrNPV and recorded low pupal weight in all the treatments than control. The fertility and fecundity of infected adult moths was significantly reduced when compared to the untreated insects in a concentration dependent fashion. Sub-lethal effects of baculoviral infection on different biological parameters were studied. Mean developmental period of infected 3rd and 4th larval instars was significantly higher (F = 2.945; F = 18.414; df = 5, 20; P < 0.05) in SpfrNPV infected larvae than the control at all tested viral concentrations. The percentage of pupal mortality ranged from 40.74 to 72.73 in the lowest and highest concentrations of SpfrNPV, respectively. Developmental period of male pupae was found to be significantly longer in infected groups than the uninfected ones. The infected adults had significantly reduced longevity in both males ranged from 3.5 to 5.75 (F = 6.273; P = 0.002) and females ranged from 3.5 to7.00 (F = 13.652; P = 0.001). Further, the mates of virus-treated adults showed a highly reduced egg production (F = 31.255; P < 0.05) ranged from 150.03 to 338.33 and the larval emerging ranged from 71.11 to 227.89 (F = 74.52; P < 0.05), which was again significantly lower than the control. The percentage of egg hatching ranged from 47.40 to 86.41%. Conclusions: The sub-lethal effect of SpfrNPV has observed on the growth and development and also reduced percentage of egg hatching in the subsequent generation. Hence, this indigenous SpfrNPV strain can be used in the sustainable and resilience IPM program.

This is reflected in visual attention: people immediately attend towards and look longer at attractive faces, especially when they are motivated to find a partner. However, previous studies did not incorporate real-life dating decisions. Here, we aimed to combine attentional tasks with individual attractiveness ratings and a real-life mate choice context, namely a speed-dating paradigm. We investigated whether heterosexual non-committed young adults showed biases in immediate and voluntary attention towards attractive faces and preferred dating partners. In line with previous research, we found considerable individual differences in individual attractiveness preferences. Furthermore, our results showed that men had a bias towards attractive faces and preferred dating partners in the immediate attention task, while results for women were mixed. In the voluntary attention task, however, both men and women had an attentional bias towards attractive faces and preferred dating partners. Our results suggest that individual attractiveness preferences are good predictors of especially voluntary attention. We discuss these findings from an evolutionary perspective and suggest directions for future research. © 2023, The Author(s).",,"adult; article; attention; attentional bias; case report; clinical article; female; heterosexuality; human; human experiment; male; mate choice; velocity; young adult; attentional bias; decision making; esthetics; heterosexuality; individuality; Attentional Bias; Beauty; Choice Behavior; Female; Heterosexuality; Humans; Individuality; Male; Young Adult"

The profit of a breed is in general a quantity that predicts the satisfaction of future owners with their breed, and the satisfaction of the consumers with the products that are produced by the breed. Many traits, such as conformation traits and product quality traits have intermediate optima. Traditional selection index theory applies only to directional selection and cannot achieve any further improvement once the trait means have reached their optima. A well-founded theory is needed that extends the established selection index theory to cover directional as well as stabilizing selection as limiting cases, and that can be applied to maximize the profit of a breed in both situations. Results: The optimum selection index shifts the trait means towards the optima and, in the case of stabilizing selection, decreases the phenotypic variance, which causes the phenotypes to be closer to the optimum. The optimum index depends not only on the breeding values, but also on the squared breeding values, the allele contents of major quantitative trait loci (QTL), the QTL heterozygosities, the inbreeding coefficient of the animal, and the kinship of the animal with the population. Conclusion: The optimum selection index drives the alleles of major QTL to fixation when the trait mean approaches the optimum because decreasing the phenotypic variance shifts the trait values closer to the optimum, which increases the profit of the breed. The index weight on the kinship coefficient balances the increased genetic gain that can be achieved in future generations by outcrossing, and the increased genetic gain that can be achieved under stabilizing selection by reducing the phenotypic variance.

The combining ability between potential mating partners, which predicts the total merit of their offspring, could become an important parameter for mate allocation that could be used to further shift the phenotypes towards their optimum values. © 2023, The Author(s).",,"allele; ecological theory; inbreeding depression; index method; kinship; allele; animal; biological model; genetic selection; heterozygote; inbreeding; phenotype; quantitative trait locus; Alleles; Animals; Heterozygote; Inbreeding; Models, Genetic; Phenotype; Quantitative Trait Loci; Selection, Genetic"

Although the species collision operator in the AAP model conserves fully the mass, momentum, and energy for the mixture, it does not conserve the momentum and energy for each species due to the inter-species collisions. In this work, the species collision operator is decomposed into two parts: one part is fully conservative for the species and the other represents the excess part. With this decomposition, the kinetic equation is solved using the Strang-splitting method, in which the excess part of the collision operator is treated as a source, while the kinetic equation with the species conservative part is solved by the standard DUGKS. Particularly, the time integration of the source term is realized by either explicit or implicit Euler scheme. By this means, it is easy to extend the scheme to gas mixtures composed of Maxwell or hard-sphere molecules, while the previous DUGKS [Zhang Y, Zhu L, Wang R et al, Phys Rev E 97(5):053306, 2018] of binary gases was only designed for Maxwell molecules. Several tests are performed to validate the scheme, including the shock structure under different Mach numbers and molar concentrations, the Couette flow under different mass ratios, and the pressure-driven Poiseuille flow in different flow regimes. The results are compared with those from other reliable numerical methods based on different models. And the influence of molecular model on the flow characteristics is studied. The results also show that the present DUGKS with implicit source discretization is more stable and preferable for gas mixture problems involving different flow regimes. © 2023, The Author(s).","AAP model; Discrete unified gas-kinetic scheme; Multi-species gas; Strang-splitting method","Binary mixtures; Conservation; Integral equations; Kinetic energy; Kinetic theory; Kinetics; Molecules; Numerical methods; Andry-aoki-perthame model; Collision operators; Discrete unified gas-kinetic scheme; Flow regimes; Gas kinetic scheme; Multi-species; Multi-species gas; Splitting method; Strang splitting; String-splitting method; Gas mixtures"

Understanding the formation of advising relationships can help contextualize their later development and ultimately support a student’s decision to persist in the doctorate. To understand relationship formation, the purpose of this qualitative study is to identify and describe the types of advisor–advisee selection processes that exist in engineering, science, and math doctoral programs and examine patterns across disciplines within those fields. We conducted interviews with doctoral program directors and engaged in document analysis of graduate student handbooks from 55 doctoral programs in the aforementioned fields in high research institutions across the United States. Using principal–agent theory as a theoretical lens, our findings showed that engineering programs tend to decentralize the advisor selection process by funding students across different funding sources upon enrollment. Contrariwise, science and math programs tended to fund all students in a cohort from a common funding source, which allowed students to have more time to gather information, meet, and select an advisor. These findings also show important nuances when comparing graduate education in these programs that directly impact the doctoral student experience and reiterates the necessity to study these fields separately. © 2023, The Author(s).","Advisor selection; Doctoral students; Graduate education; Qualitative secondary analysis",

However, there is an inter-individual variation in the response to exercise and the tolerability to high-intensity exercise. Identifying potential moderating factors, such as inflammation and treatment type, for changes in muscle strength is important to improve the effectiveness of exercise programs. Therefore, we aimed to investigate if inflammation and type of oncological treatment moderate the effects of exercise intensity (high vs. low-moderate) on muscular strength changes in patients with breast (BRCA) or prostate cancer (PRCA). Methods: Participants with BRCA (n = 286) and PRCA (n = 65) from the Physical training and Cancer study (Phys-Can) were included in the present study. Participants performed a combined resistance- and endurance exercise program during six months, at either high or low-moderate intensity. Separate regression models were estimated for each cancer type, with and without interaction terms. Moderators included in the models were treatment type (i.e., neo/adjuvant chemotherapy—yes/no for BRCA, adjuvant androgen deprivation therapy (ADT)—yes/no for PRCA)), and inflammation (interleukin 6 (IL6) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFα)) at follow-up. Results: For BRCA, neither IL6 (b = 2.469, 95% CI [− 7.614, 12.552]) nor TNFα (b = 0.036, 95% CI [− 6.345, 6.418]) levels moderated the effect of exercise intensity on muscle strength change. The same was observed for chemotherapy treatment (b = 4.893, 95% CI [− 2.938, 12.724]). Similarly, for PRCA, the effect of exercise intensity on muscle strength change was not moderated by IL6 (b = − 1.423, 95% CI [− 17.894, 15.048]) and TNFα (b = − 1.905, 95% CI [− 8.542, 4.732]) levels, nor by ADT (b = − 0.180, 95% CI [− 11.201, 10.841]). Conclusions: The effect of exercise intensity on muscle strength is not moderated by TNFα, IL6, neo/adjuvant chemotherapy, or ADT, and therefore cannot explain any intra-variation of training response regarding exercise intensity (e.g., strength gain) for BRCA or PRCA in this setting.

However, these species are reproductively isolated by a double sterility barrier. The first barrier is mainly due to the failure of the chromosomes to pair in allodiploid meiosis. The second barrier ensures that the hybrid remains sterile even after genome duplication, an event that can restore fertility in plant interspecies hybrids. The latter is attributable to the autodiploidisation of the allotetraploid meiosis that results in sterile allodiploid spores (return to the first barrier). Occasionally, mating-competent alloaneuploid spores arise by malsegregation of MAT-carrying chromosomes. These can mate with cells of a third species resulting in aneuploid zygotes having at least one incomplete subgenome. Here we report on the construction of euploid three-species hybrids by making use of “rare mating” between a sterile S. kudriavzevii x S. uvarum allodiploid hybrid and a diploid S. cerevisiae strain. The hybrids have allotetraploid 2nScnSk nSu genomes consisting of complete sets of parental chromosomes. This is the first report on the production of euploid three-species Saccharomyces hybrids by natural mating, without genetic manipulation. The hybrids provide possibilities for studying the interactions of three allospecific genomes and their orthologous genes present in the same cell. © 2023, The Author(s).",,"fungal genome; genetics; hybridization; Saccharomyces; Saccharomyces cerevisiae; Genome, Fungal; Hybridization, Genetic; Saccharomyces; Saccharomyces cerevisiae"

The larval host range of western corn rootworm, Diabrotica virgifera virgifera (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae), is restricted to maize and a few grasses. Resistance of D. v. virgifera to crop rotation practices and multiple insecticides contributes to its status as the most damaging pest of cultivated maize in North America and Europe. The extent to which adaptations by this pest contributes to host plant specialization remains unknown. Results: A 2.42 Gb draft D. v. virgifera genome, Dvir_v2.0, was assembled from short shotgun reads and scaffolded using long-insert mate-pair, transcriptome and linked read data. K-mer analysis predicted a repeat content of ≥ 61.5%. Ortholog assignments for Dvir_2.0 RefSeq models predict a greater number of species-specific gene duplications, including expansions in ATP binding cassette transporter and chemosensory gene families, than in other Coleoptera. A majority of annotated D. v. virgifera cytochrome P450s belong to CYP4, 6, and 9 clades. A total of 5,404 transcripts were differentially-expressed between D. v. virgifera larvae fed maize roots compared to alternative host (Miscanthus), a marginal host (Panicum virgatum), a poor host (Sorghum bicolor) and starvation treatments; Among differentially-expressed transcripts, 1,908 were shared across treatments and the least number were between Miscanthus compared to maize. Differentially-expressed transcripts were enriched for putative spliceosome, proteosome, and intracellular transport functions. General stress pathway functions were unique and enriched among up-regulated transcripts in marginal host, poor host, and starvation responses compared to responses on primary (maize) and alternate hosts. Conclusions: Manual annotation of D. v. virgifera Dvir_2.0 RefSeq models predicted expansion of paralogs with gene families putatively involved in insecticide resistance and chemosensory perception. Our study also suggests that adaptations of D. v. virgifera larvae to feeding on an alternate host plant invoke fewer transcriptional changes compared to marginal or poor hosts. The shared up-regulation of stress response pathways between marginal host and poor host, and starvation treatments may reflect nutrient deprivation. This study provides insight into transcriptomic responses of larval feeding on different host plants and resources for genomic research on this economically significant pest of maize. © 2022, This is a U.S. Government work and not under copyright protection in the US; foreign copyright protection may apply.","Differential expression; Genome assembly; Host plant specialization","ABC transporter; cytochrome P450; cytochrome P450 family 4; cytochrome P450 family 6; cytochrome P450 family 9; proteasome; transcriptome; unclassified drug; endotoxin; insecticide; adult; animal experiment; Article; beetle; chemoreceptor; cladistics; controlled study; Diabrotica virgifera virgifera; differential gene expression; down regulation; evolutionary adaptation; feeding; female; gene duplication; genetic transcription; genome; host; host plant specialization; intracellular transport; larva; maize; Miscanthus; molecular genetics; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; orthology; Panicum virgatum; pest control; plant root; plant stress; predictive model; sorghum; species differentiation; spliceosome; starvation; tandem repeat; upregulation; whole genome sequencing; animal; beetle; biological pest control; genetics; maize; metabolism; physiology; Poaceae; transgenic plant; Animals; Coleoptera; Endotoxins; Insecticides; Larva; Pest Control, Biological; Plants, Genetically Modified; Poaceae; Zea mays"

In this regard, 3D bioprinting has emerged as one of the most promising new technologies, offering novel treatment options. Additionally, the latest achievements from the fields of biomaterials and tissue engineering research identified constituents facilitating the creation of biocompatible scaffolds. In this study, we looked closer at hyaluronic acid and multi-walled carbon nanotubes as bioink additives.

In this regard, 0.25 mg/ml of hyaluronic acid and 0.0625 mg/ml of carbon nanotubes were selected as the most optimal concentrations. In addition, we investigated the protective influence of 2-phospho-L-ascorbic acid in samples with carbon nanotubes. Tests conducted on 3D bioprinted constructs revealed that only a combination of components positively impacted cell viability throughout the whole experiment.

All types of ZnO formulations were characterized by comprehensive interdisciplinary approach including various instrumental techniques in order to obtain nanocomposites with suitable properties for further applications, i.e. biomedical. Based on the X- ray diffraction analysis results, all tested nanoparticles exhibited the wurtzite structure with an average crystalline size distribution of 21.1 nm (CHEM_ZnO NCs), 13.2 nm (1C_ZnO NCs) and 12.9 nm (4a_ZnO NCs). The microscopy approach with use of broad range of detectors (SE, BF, HAADF) revealed the core–shell structure of bio-ZnO NCs, compared to the chemical one. The nanoparticles core of 1C and 4a_ZnO NCs are coated by the specific organic deposit coming from the metabolites produced by two probiotic strains, L. fermentum and L. curvatus. Vibrational infrared spectroscopy, photoluminescence (PL) and mass spectrometry (LDI-TOF-MS) have been used to monitor the ZnO NCs surface chemistry and allowed for better description of bio-NCs organic coating composition (amino acids residues). The characterized ZnO formulations were then assessed for their photocatalytic properties against methylene blue (MB). Both types of bio-ZnO NCs exhibited good photocatalytic activity, however, the effect of CHEM_ZnO NCs was more potent than bio-ZnO NCs. Finally, the colloidal stability of the tested nanoparticles were investigated based on the zeta potential (ZP) and hydrodynamic diameter measurements in dependence of the nanocomposites concentration and investigation time. During the biosynthesis of nano-ZnO, the increment of pH from 5.7 to around 8 were observed which suggested possible contribution of zinc aquacomplexes and carboxyl-rich compounds resulted in conversion of zinc tetrahydroxy ion complex to ZnO NCs. Overall results in present study suggest that used accessible source such us probiotic strains, L. fermentum and L. curvatus, for extracellular bio-ZnO NCs synthesis are of high interest. What is important, no significant differences between organic deposit (e.g. metabolites) produced by tested strains were noticed—both of them allowed to form the nanoparticles with natural origin coating. In comparison to chemical ZnO NCs, those synthetized via microbiological route are promising material with further biological potential once have shown high stability during 7 days. © 2023, The Author(s).",,"nanoparticle; zinc; zinc oxide; chemistry; infrared spectroscopy; X ray crystallography; Crystallography, X-Ray; Nanoparticles; Spectroscopy, Fourier Transform Infrared; Zinc; Zinc Oxide"

Such cognitive differences often manifest early in life as differential school performance and have a strong genetic basis. Here we measured genetic predictors of school performance in 30,982 individuals in English, Danish and mathematics via a genome-wide association study (GWAS) and studied their relationship with risk for six major psychiatric disorders. When decomposing the school performance into math and language-specific performances, we observed phenotypically and genetically a strong negative correlation between math performance and risk for most psychiatric disorders. But language performance correlated positively with risk for certain disorders, especially schizophrenia, which we replicate in an independent sample (n = 4547). We also found that the genetic variants relating to increased risk for schizophrenia and better language performance are overrepresented in individuals involved in creative professions (n = 2953) compared to the general population (n = 164,622). The findings together suggest that language ability, creativity and psychopathology might stem from overlapping genetic roots. © 2023, The Author(s).",,"cognition; creativity; genome-wide association study; human; language; mental disease; Cognition; Creativity; Genome-Wide Association Study; Humans; Language; Mental Disorders"

Methods: Postmolar GTN received P-Chem was defined as P-Chem group. Postmolar GTN without P-chem was randomly selected as control group according to the ratio of 1:3 (P-chem:control) and matched by age for low risk and high risk GTN separately. Results: Totally 455 low-risk and 32 high-risk postmolar GTN patients were included. WHO risk score, chemotherapy cycles to achieve hCG normalization and resistant rate were similar between P-chem (27 cases) and control (81 cases) group. Among low-risk GTN patients, interval from hydatidiform mole to GTN was significantly longer in P-chem group than control (44 vs 69 days, P = 0.001). Total chemotherapy cycles and resistant rate were similar between low-risk GTN treated with same agent as P-chem (group A) and alternative agent (group B). But group A needed more chemotherapy cycles to achieve hCG normalization than group B.

Due to its complexity and dependence on both aerosol and raindrop sizes, wet scavenging process has been poorly treated, especially during the removal of fine particles. This makes the numerical simulation of below-cloud scavenging in large-scale aerosol models unrealistic. To consider the slip effects of submicron particles, a simplified expression for the diffusion scavenging was developed by approximating the Cunningham slip correction factor. The derived analytic solution was parameterized as a simple power function of rain intensity under the assumption of the lognormal size distribution of particles. The resultant approximated expression was compared to the observed data and the results of previous studies including a 3D atmospheric chemical transport model simulation. Compared with the default GEOS-Chem coefficient of 0.00106R0.61 and the observation-based coefficient of 0.0144R0.9268, the coefficient of a and b in Λm = aRb spread in the range of 0.0002- 0.1959 for a and 0.3261- 0.525 for b over a size distribution of GSD of 1.3–2.5 and a geometric mean diameter of 0.01- 2.5 µm. Overall, this study showed that the scavenging coefficient varies widely by orders of magnitude according to the size distribution of particles and rain intensity. This study also demonstrated that the obtained simplified expression could consider the theoretical approach of aerosol polydispersity. Our proposed analytic approach showed that results can be effectively applied for reduced computational burden in atmospheric modeling. © 2022","Below-cloud scavenging; Cunningham correction factor; Parameterization; Polydisperse aerosol; Scavenging coefficient","Atmospheric chemistry; Atmospheric movements; Parameterization; Polydispersity; Rain; Size distribution; Below-cloud scavenging; Correction factors; Cunningham correction factor; Distribution of particles; Polydisperse aerosols; Rain-intensity; Scavenging coefficients; Scavenging process; Simplified expressions; Size-distribution; Aerosols; aerosol; atmospheric transport; cloud classification; concentration (composition); parameterization; precipitation intensity; scavenging (chemistry)"

Indeed, radiation events, due to the release of high Z impurities, such as Nickel and Copper, and W sputtered from the divertor, can strongly reduce the power crossing the plasma separatrix and slow the ELMs dynamics, thus inducing H to L transition. In particular, in JET baseline plasmas, because of the outward neoclassical transport [A.R. Field et al 2021 Plasma Phys. Control. Fusion 63 095013], plasma impurities are mainly localized in the mantle region, as detected by a real-time surrogate model for bolometer tomography based on machine learning [D.R. Ferreira et al 2021 Fusion Engineering and Design 164], and the consequent excessive radiation in this region is the main cause of plasma termination in recent Deuterium, Tritium and Deuterium-Tritium operations. To guarantee impurity accumulation being flushed by the ELMs, ELM control schemes, which ensure a throughput of particles, either via gas fueling and via pellets, have been exploited. In this work, the staged approach strategy towards radiation control, which allowed to sustain for more than 10 s Tritium and Deuterium-Tritium baseline discharges without radiation issues, is presented. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","DT; JET; Plasma; Plasma termination; Radiation control; Real-time control; Tritium operation","Deuterium; Electric discharges; Tokamak devices; Tritium; Deuterium deuteriums; Deuterium-tritium; DT; Ion temperature; Plasma performance; Plasma radiation; Plasma termination; Radiation controls; Real-time control; Tritium operation; Real time control"

Appl. 18, 027,001 (2022)) has remarked that the nonreciprocal emitters of existing schemes are greatly limited by the small angular range since they typically occurred at rather large angles. Here, to address the key challenge, a novel scheme, based on the cascaded dielectric-magneto-optical (MO) material grating structure, is proposed and investigated. It is shown that near-unity emission and little absorption can be achieved simultaneously at the same wavelength, leading to near-perfect nonreciprocal radiation for an angle of only 1°. The underlying physical mechanism is revealed through illustrating the distributions of magnetic field amplitude. Besides, the possibility to realize strong nonreciprocity with the magnetic field as small as possible is investigated. Last, the angular ranges which can be realized by the proposed scheme are also investigated.

Flux calculation is one of the fundamental elements in molecular simulations. Several-decades-long research efforts on the subject made significant progresses since the pioneering work of Irving and Kirkwood [J. Chem. Phys, (1950) 18, 817–829]. However, some issues remain regarding the fluxes in the flow direction. The streaming velocity (SV) and the fluxes independent of SV are difficult to manage during computation. For example, the local fluxes and SV that vary in more than one direction are not well represented despite being prevalent in the microscopic phenomena such as nanofluidics, biotechnologies, and energy conversions. The technique presented in this paper is based on the instantaneous microscopic conservation equations and depends only on the total fluxes that include the convective contributions. This allows a calculation of all the fluxes at the end of a simulation run, with no complication arising in terms of defining and collecting SV, pressure tensor, and heat flux vector. Widely-used methods such as the method of planes and volume-average method were adapted, respectively. This study then investigated a planar shear flow in a highly confined channel, where a flow is unknown at the beginning of a simulation, and the controversial streamwise heat flux with no temperature gradient was present. The flow and fluxes were structured, and the streamwise heat flux evolved significantly and slowly over a few tens of nano-seconds even with steady boundary conditions. © 2023 Elsevier Masson SAS","Molecular simulation; Nanofluidics; Particle simulation","Heat flux; Molecular structure; Shear flow; Conservation equations; Flow direction; Flux calculations; Flux velocity; Molecular simulations; Particle simulations; Research efforts; Streaming velocity; Total flux; Velocity-pressure; Nanofluidics"

In this study, we checked the influence of winter harshness on the sex ratio of Mallards overwintering in urban waterbodies with an emphasis on differences at the local scale within a single town. Our study shows that in harsh winter seasons, there was a lower share of males among wintering Mallards. It seems that females, despite their smaller body size and higher specific metabolic rate, found favourable conditions in the urban area during cold weather. Towns are characterized by a milder winter climate than rural areas, moreover birds profit from the supplementary feeding by humans. In severe weather conditions, females remained in urban waterbodies together with their paired mate, whereas unpaired males possibly left the town in search of sites with less competition, as they occupy a lower position in the flock hierarchy than paired individuals. We also found such differences on a local scale, with the proportion of males decreasing with decreasing temperature. Obtained results suggest that the sex- and status-dependent response to even a slight temperature change during the winter period is probably the most important factor shaping the variation in the proportion of male and female Mallards in flocks, at least in areas with a high abundance of anthropogenic food, which is likely to weaken competition between the sexes for resources. © 2023 Elsevier Masson SAS","Gdańsk; Sexual segregation; Wildfowl ecology; Winter harshness","bird; gender discrimination; Northern Hemisphere; overwintering; severe weather; sex ratio; temperature gradient; urban area"

This paper then assesses the performance of the proposed winding concept within a context 20 MW FSCG design.

One of the most utilized approaches for magnetoquasistatic simulations in applied superconductivity is the H formulation. However, due to the large number of degrees of freedom (DOFs) present when modeling large and complex systems (e.g. large coils for fusion applications, electrical machines, and medical applications) using the standard H formulation on a desktop machine becomes infeasible. The H formulation solves the Faraday's law formulated in terms of the magnetic field intensity \mathbf {H} using edge elements in the whole modeling domain. For this reason, a very high resistivity is assumed for the non-conducting domains, leading to an ill-conditioned system matrix and therefore long computation times. In contrast, the H-\phi formulation uses the H formulation in the conducting region, and the \phi formulation (magnetic scalar potential) in the surrounding non-conducting domains, drastically reducing DOFs and computation time. In this work, we use the H-\phi formulation in 2D for the magnetothermal (AC losses and quench) analysis of stacks of REBCO tapes. The same approach is extended to a 3D case for the AC loss analysis of a twisted superconducting wire. All the results obtained by simulations in Sparselizard are compared with results obtained with COMSOL. Our custom tool allows us to distribute the simulations over hundreds of CPUs using domain decomposition methods, considerably reducing the simulation times without compromising accuracy. © 2002-2011 IEEE.","AC Loss; cloud; DDM; formulation; HTS; modeling; quench; REBCO","Critical current density (superconductivity); Degrees of freedom (mechanics); Domain decomposition methods; Initial value problems; Magnetic domains; Magnetization; Maxwell equations; Medical applications; Numerical methods; Superconducting coils; Superconducting magnets; Wire; <inline-formula xmlns:ali=""; > <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$H$</tex-math> </inline-formula>-<inline-formula xmlns:ali=""; > <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$\phi$</tex-math> </inline-formula>-formulation; AC loss; Computational modelling; DDM; High-temperature superconductor; HTS; Modeling; Quench; REBCO; Xmlns:mml=""; Xmlns:xlink=""; Xmlns:xsi=""; High temperature superconductors"

The synthesized nanocarriers had a loading capacity of 790 μg mg−1 for baicalein (BA) and performed excellent pH-triggered drug release behavior under the acidic condition of pH 5.0. Polydopamine (PDA) coating endowed the drug delivery system (DDS) with good photothermal performance, and the photothermal conversion efficiency (η) was 39.48% under 808 nm laser irradiation for 10 min. Then, PEGylation was performed using amino-terminated PEG (PEG-NH2) to provide high biocompatibility and stability. In addition, PEGylation and PDA-coating assisted in improving the hemolytic toxicity and cytotoxicity of bare nanocarriers. Furthermore, in vitro cellular studies showed that DDS of BZPP had excellent cellular internalization in A549 cells and enhanced synergistic anti-tumor ability to cancer cells compared to monotherapy. Therefore, BZPP can be used as a powerful chemo-photothermal synergistic therapy strategy to improve the insufficiency of mono-chemotherapy and has unexceptionable prospects for the therapy of tumor. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","Baicalein; Drug delivery system; Photothermal therapy; Polydopamine; ZIF-8","Cancer cells; Chemotherapy; Coatings; Controlled drug delivery; Conversion efficiency; Diseases; Targeted drug delivery; Tumors; Baicalein; Drug-delivery systems; Nanocarriers; PEgylation; Photo-thermal; Photothermal effects; Photothermal therapy; Polydopamine; Polydopamine coating; ZIF-8; Biocompatibility"

Individuals may initially be attracted to others who are like themselves (i.e., have assortative preferences). Alternatively, couples may become more similar over time. These explanations have been difficult to disentangle. Assortative mating may be less common in online situations as barriers related to social homogamy are removed. The current study experimentally investigates which, if any, of the Big Five personality traits were assortatively preferred in an online environment. Methods: Online volunteers and paid participants (205 females and 178 males) viewed 100 ostensible dating profiles comprised of random pairings of facial images and personal descriptions, the latter of which were pre-rated for perceived personality. Participants indicated whether they would like to “match” with each profile, mimicking responses made on dating applications, and completed the Big Five Inventory (BFI-44). Results: Participants showed assortative preferences for agreeableness, openness, and extraversion, but not for conscientiousness or emotional stability. Conclusion: These results suggest that people exhibit assortative preferences in an online dating app environment. If these online preferences translate to long-term relationships, this could help explain similarities found in established couples identified in previous research. © 2023 The Authors","Attraction; Big Five personality; Dating applications; Mate preferences; Partner similarity; Personality preferences","adult; article; emotional stability; extraversion; face; female; homogamy; human; human experiment; major clinical study; male; mate choice; online dating; personality"

The program can also carry out calculations in the multiple-structure local harmonic (MS-LH) approximation or multi-structural local quasiharmonic (MS-LQ) approximation or by the dual-level MS-T method. Furthermore, the program package includes eight utility codes that can be used as stand-alone programs to help the user to generate the input files for the code or to generate comparison results. The 2023 version of MSTor includes a new capability, namely automatic identification of torsional modes with redundant internal coordinates. New version program summary: Program title: MSTor 2023 CPC Library link to program files: https://doi.org/10.17632/t4y5wds856.1 Licensing provisions: Apache 2.0 Programming language: Fortran 90, C, and Perl Journal references of previous versions: Comput. Phys. Comm. 183 (2012) 1803; Comput. Phys. Comm. 184 (2013) 2032 Does the new version supersede the previous version?: Yes. Nature of problem: Calculation of the partition functions and thermodynamic functions (standard-state energy, enthalpy, entropy, and free energy as functions of temperature) of molecules or transition states involving multiple torsional motions. Solution method: The program uses the multi-structural approximation with torsional anharmonicity, a coupled torsional potential, and delocalized torsions MS-T(CD) [1]. The program also provides results for the multi-structural local harmonic approximation or local quasiharmonic approximation, and it can also be used for the original multi-structural approximation with torsional anharmonicity and a coupled torsional potential MS-T(C) [2] or an uncoupled torsional potential MS-T(U) [3]. The program can also carry out dual-level [4] MS-T(CD), MS-T(C), and MS-T(U) calculations. Reasons for new version: The new version increases functionality and is more user friendly. The main enhancement is the capability for automatic identification of torsional modes with redundant internal coordinates. Summary of revisions: A newly developed torsional identification approach for complex molecules has been implemented in the MSTor program. The method, called multi-structural torsion method with a coupled torsional potential and delocalized torsions MS-T(CD), is based on Baker et al.'s delocalized internal-coordinates method and on Zheng and Truhlar's torsional projection method. By using a redundant-internal-coordinate auto-generation procedure, the MS-T(CD) method circumvents the need in the original MS-T method for the user to define nonredundant internal coordinates, and it can straightforwardly identify and separate the coupled torsions from the Cartesian Hessian. This greatly simplifies the user input, and it helps users to obtain robust and consistent results. MSTor now sets the redundant internal coordinate scheme as the default method. A new utility code, DLMSTor.exe, is provided to allow dual-level calculations. The $framechain and $framedef sections were reintroduced to the code as optional sections. If these sections are used, the D matrix is calculated using the scheme of Kilpatrick and Pitzer and one should always get correct values for the moments of inertia. Various utility codes were modified to help ensure that structures that are equivalent under rotation to other structures (and thus indistinguishable when considering overall rotation and torsions) are still properly included in the Voronoi tessellation step (which does not fully exploit overall rotational symmetry). The mcvorm.exe utility code was modified to correctly calculate uncertainties and to take advantage of rotational symmetries (at least for linear-chain molecules) and mirror-image symmetries, if present, in the calculation of the uncertainty estimates. We added a new keyword, MTUMME, that provides an option to write a density-of-states file for version 2023 (in preparation) of the TUMME [5] master equation program. Some minor bugs are fixed so the code now compiles properly with the GNU gfortran compiler (version 12.2.1), the NVidia HPC Fortran compiler pgfortran (version 21.3), and the Intel compiler ifort. The output format is cleaned, and unused variables and arrays are removed. The new version has an increased number of test runs, and the manual is improved and updated. The program authors are J.

These tick species are vectors for many zoonotic pathogens, and their northward range expansion presents a serious threat to public health. Climate change (particularly increasing temperature) has been identified as an important driver permitting northward range expansion of blacklegged ticks, but the impacts of host movement, which is essential to tick dispersal into new climatically suitable regions, have received limited investigation. Here, a mechanistic movement model was applied to landscapes of eastern North America to explore 1) relationships between multiple ecological drivers and the speed of the northward invasion of blacklegged ticks infected with the causative agent of Lyme disease, Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto, and 2) its capacity to simulate the northward range expansion of infected blacklegged ticks and uninfected lone star ticks under theoretical scenarios of increasing temperature. Our results suggest that the attraction of migratory birds (long-distance tick dispersal hosts) to resource-rich areas during their spring migration and the mate-finding Allee effect in tick population dynamics are key drivers for the spread of infected blacklegged ticks. The modeled increases in temperature extended the climatically suitable areas of Canada for infected blacklegged ticks and uninfected lone star ticks towards higher latitudes by up to 31% and 1%, respectively, and with an average predicted speed of the range expansion reaching 61 km/year and 23 km/year, respectively. Differences in the projected spatial distribution patterns of these tick species were due to differences in climate envelopes of tick populations, as well as the availability and attractiveness of suitable habitats for migratory birds. Our results indicate that the northward invasion process of lone star ticks is primarily driven by local dispersal of resident terrestrial hosts, whereas that of blacklegged ticks is governed by long-distance migratory bird dispersal. The results also suggest that mechanistic movement models provide a powerful approach for predicting tick-borne disease risk patterns under complex scenarios of climate, socioeconomic and land use/land cover changes. © 2023","Amblyomma americanum; Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto; Climate warming; Ixodes scapularis; Reaction-advection-diffusion model; Spatial expansion","adult; Amblyomma americanum; Article; Borrelia burgdorferi; Canada; climate change; controlled study; female; geographic distribution; habitat; Ixodes scapularis; land use; landscape; latitude; Lyme disease; male; mating; migrant bird; nonhuman; North America; parasite survival; parasitism; population dynamics; population structure; prediction; seasonal variation; sensitivity analysis; socioeconomics; temperature; tick; tick borne disease"

Herein, lignin's novel chemical modification (amination) has been developed to produce high quantity pyrrolic-N moieties as active sites. Furthermore, chemically modified amine moieties in lignin are vital as a natural self-activating template to generate hierarchical porosity in the 2D (graphene-like) architecture with exceedingly high surface area (2926.4 m2g−1). The rationally introduced dominated pyrrolic-N moieties boost the Zn-ion storage capacity and reaction kinetics due to the dual energy storage mechanism and efficient charge transfer between pyrrolic-N and Zn+2 ions. Furthermore, the pyrrolic-N species are energetically favorable for the adsorption of Zn+2 ions by the formation of N-Zn+2 chemical bonds. Besides, the nitrogen oxides reduce the intrinsic resistance and induce a more polarized surface, resulting in high wettability and efficient transfer of electrolytes into the pores of hydrophobic carbon materials. Subsequently, the chemically modified lignin-derived activated carbon material (Chem-ACM) as a cathode in ZICs delivers a high capacity of 161.2 mA h g−1 at 1 A g−1 with the admirable energy density of 106.7 W h kg−1 at 897 W kg−1 and excellent retention capacity (94%) after 10,000 cycles. Mainly, the assembled quasi solid-state ZICs using Chem-ACM retains the remarkable storage capacity (202 mA h g−1 at 0.2 Ag−1) even at a high bending angle. Notably, the Chem-ACM has been further employed in symmetric supercapacitors as an electrode, and it displays exceptional specific capacitance of 354 Fg−1 at 0.5 Ag−1 with tremendous energy (43.5 W h kg−1) and the power density (0.53 kW kg−1). Additionally, the charge storage capability of Chem-ACM is positively dependent on high nitrogen contents, and it is extrapolated that pyrrolic-N moieties are dominant active sites. Hence, the designed amination-assisted biocarbon synthesis provides a new way to prepare high nitrogen-containing biocarbon for ZICs and further understand pyrrolic-N species' impact on Zn-ion storage. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.","Activated carbon; Amination; Hybrid supercapacitors; Lignin; Pyrrolic nitrogen","Activated carbon; Amines; Cathodes; Charge transfer; Chemical modification; Chemical stability; Electric discharges; Electrochemical electrodes; Energy storage; Lignin; Nitrogen oxides; Reaction kinetics; Storage (materials); Supercapacitor; Active site; Carbon material; Chemically modified; Hybrid supercapacitors; Ion storage; Modified lignins; Pyrrolic; Pyrrolic nitrogen; Storage capacity; Zn ions; Ions; activated carbon; electrolyte; graphene; lignin; nitrogen; nitrogen oxide; pyrrole derivative; zinc ion; adsorption kinetics; amination; Article; carbonization; chemical bond; chemical modification; chemical reaction kinetics; electrochemical analysis; hydrophobicity; porosity; solid state; surface area; wettability; Activated Carbon; Amines; Cathodes; Charge Transfer; Nitrogen Oxides"

Although children start using educational apps from early age, only a few apps adhere to interaction design recommendations and undergo empirical evaluation of their educational potential. In this paper, we describe the concept and design of an app developed for promoting early math learning through finger-based multi-touch interactions in kindergarten children. Drawing from research on embodied cognition, our app provides games for fostering finger counting as well as finger-based representation of cardinal magnitude and part-whole relations. The app's efficiency was empirically evaluated through a pre-post-intervention study design with two control conditions. Results revealed that a short-term intervention with the math app did not significantly improve children's math skills when compared to learning gains of both a content-matched, unplugged math training program and a passive, waiting list control group. We discuss possible methodological reasons underlying these results, considering key curricular differences for the effectiveness of app-based interventions in early childhood education.

Research has shown that children who enter school with relatively low math skills are unlikely to catch up to peers who begin kindergarten with more developed math skills. Emerging evidence suggests that children's executive function skills might play an important role in shaping the rate and stability of mathematical skill development during early development. Therefore in the present study, we used data from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Kindergarten Cohort 2010-11—a prospective sample of over 18,000 children in the United States—to examine executive function as an antecedent to characteristics of growth in math skills and to test whether executive function moderates the longitudinal stability of math achievement from kindergarten through second grade. Latent growth curve models reveal that executive function is related to not only the level of math skills at school entry but also to the rate of growth in early elementary years. Moreover, we found that executive function moderated the stability of math achievement from kindergarten to second grade, suggesting that early executive function skills can serve as a compensatory mechanism for children who enter school with lower levels of mathematical skills. These findings might have important implications for narrowing gaps in math achievement during early elementary school. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.","Early childhood; Early elementary grades; Executive function; Latent growth curve models; Math achievement","achievement; article; child; childhood; cohort analysis; executive function; female; growth curve; growth rate; human; infant; kindergarten; longitudinal study; male; primary school; skill; United States"

Math anxiety is a negative emotional response that is characterized by avoidance and feelings of stress and anxiety in situations involving mathematical reasoning. Math anxiety in students has been suggested to dampening learning and mastering of mathematics. Among various math skills, the ability to do conceptual knowledge of math has been confirmed to be significantly and negatively correlated with math anxiety. As an essential type of knowledge in mathematics, conceptual understanding is defined as an implicit or explicit understanding of the principles that govern a domain and of the relationships between units of knowledge in a domain. Neuroimaging studies have shown that the regions of the brain needed for processing mathematical conceptual knowledge might differ from those needed for other types of math such as calculation or basic numerical processing. Doing conceptual knowledge of math reportedly activated brain regions that are related to numerical processing, such as the bilateral intraparietal sulcus (IPS), as well as brain regions associated with general conceptual knowledge processing, such as the left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and left middle temporal gyrus (MTG). Although the correlation between conceptual math skill and math anxiety has been confirmed at the behavioral level, the neural mechanism remains unknown. Previous studies found that in people with high math anxiety, brain regions related to negative emotions were found to be more active during the numerical tasks, while regions related to emotion regulation and the processing of numbers and calculations were less active. In addition to hyper-activation of the emotional network, brain regions that govern mathematical tasks, showed reduced activation in people with high math anxiety. To address the neural mechanism that allows math anxiety to impede the processing of conceptual math, we used resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to determine how brain activity is related to the effects that math anxiety has on the performance of problems that test conceptual math knowledge. (1) we selected four regions of interest (ROIs) that were considered as important neural substrates for processing arithmetic principles in a previous fMRI study. We performed correlation analysis between the seed-based FC maps and the performance of math conceptual knowledge to construct neural pathways that process math conceptual knowledge. (2) we utilized mediation analysis to investigate the relationships between math anxiety, the performance of math conceptual knowledge, and the possible neural pathways. To avoid numerical formats that would likely induce confounding math anxiety, we used a verbalized arithmetic principles task. After excluding trait anxiety and state anxiety abnormalities, as well as participants who exceed the criterion of head motion during scanning, 92 healthy adult university students (43 females), aged 18-23 years (M = 20.91, SD = 2.33) were left for the data analysis. After controlling for the extraneous factors such as language and intelligence, the partial correlation results showed a significant negative correlation between mathematical anxiety and performance on conceptual knowledge of mathematics (r = −0.26, p = 0.008), which replicated the findings of previous studies and confirmed that mathematical anxiety did inhibit individuals' learning and acquisition of conceptual knowledge of mathematics. The functional connectivity in the resting brain of individuals was correlated with different levels of mathematical anxiety in the functional connectivity between the horizontal segment of the right intraparietal sulcus and the right insula. Furthermore, this functional connectivity fully mediated the correlation between the level of mathematical anxiety and the performance of mathematical conceptual knowledge. These results suggest that the interaction between mathematical/computation-related brain regions (e.g. the horizontal segment of the intraparietal sulcus) and anxiety circuits (e.g. the insula) may be the neural basis for the negative effect of mathematical anxiety on the performance of mathematical conceptual knowledge. © 2023, Science Press.

Here, based on density functional theory calculation, the epitaxial growth of BA monolayer was simulated. GeS(001) is found to be a suitable substrate for BA monolayer to epitaxially grow on. As a common isomer of arsenene, gray arsenene should be considered during the growth, because it is also energetically and thermodynamically stable in freestanding state. However, black arsenene monolayer is more energetically and thermodynamically stable than gray arsenene monolayer on GeS(001) substrate. During the growth, two arsenene atoms easily form a dimer on GeS(001), which diffuses more quickly and isotropically than arsenene monomer. In addition, the heterojunction consisted of balck arsenene and GeS(001) is an indirect gap semiconductor, but it can transform into a direct gap semiconductor with external tensile strain along zigzag direction. Remarkably, optical adsorption spectra range of BA/GeS(001) can be more abroad than that of BA and GeS(001) bilayers.

A good layout of courtyard space is conducive to building energy efficiency and human thermal comfort. In the paper, we analyze the impacts of different design schemes of the spatial layout on the microclimate of inner courtyard space using field measurements and numerical simulation methods. The analysis of the measured data presents the main meteorological factors affecting the thermal comfort of the courtyard. The magnitude of the effects is ranked as air temperature, total solar radiation intensity, near-surface air flow rate, and relative humidity. Results of the ENVI-met simulation show that changing the cover of different underlying surface types leads to different microclimate regulation effects in the sense that the temperature and relative humidity in summer drops up to 3.53 °C and 15.59%, respectively and in winter increase up to 3.97 °C and 37.21%, respectively.

Using a regional climate-chemistry-ecology model RegCM-Chem-YIBs, we investigated the synergetic impacts of aerosol radiative effect (ARE) and atmospheric quasi-biweekly oscillation (QBWO) on a PHP event in December 2013. The event consists of two peak stages and a persistence stage between them. Process analysis shows that chemical reactions and advection are the most important processes in the accumulation of PM2.5. Chemical reactions contribute 30–40 μg m−3 hr−1 to the rapid development of PHP, which is far more than that in clean days. Through sensitivity experiments, the influences of ARE and QBWO on PM2.5 variation via changing meteorological conditions were quantified respectively. During the event, ARE leads to a reduction of 24.0% in solar radiation and −33.8% in surface air temperature. The planetary boundary layer height is lowered by 20.8%. The feedback of ARE to PM2.5 ranges from 20 to 170 μg m−3, with the largest changes at PM2.5 peak stages. In comparison, QBWO exerts dominant influence at the persistence stage, during which the East Asia trough and northerlies are weakened constantly. Besides, QBWO causes a decrease of −39.5% in wind speed and an increase of 14.3% in relative humidity near the surface. The rates of chemical process and advection are increased considerably at the first peak stage and the persistence stage. QBWO also slows down the dissipation of PHP, prolonging the pollution duration. Finally, a range of 60–110 μg m−3 increase in PM2.5 is attributed to QBWO. In all, ARE and QBWO take different roles in the formation of PHP. ARE mainly affects the pollution intensity by accelerating chemical reactions, while QBWO determines the persistence of heavy pollution by changing both advection and chemical processes. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Aerosol radiative effect; Atmospheric quasi-biweekly oscillation; Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region; Persistent heavy PM2.5 pollution",

It contributes significantly to the dynamics of global CO2 distributions and variances. Quantifying the impacts of biomass burning emissions on atmospheric CO2 concentrations is essential for global and regional carbon cycles and budgets. In this study, we performed several numerical experiments by switching and replacing inventories to estimate the impacts of four biomass burning emission inventories on atmospheric CO2 concentration simulations in 2006–2010 based on the global chemical transport model, GEOS-Chem. The results highlighted similarities and differences in the annual and seasonal variability of biomass burning emissions and simulated CO2 concentrations at global and regional scales. Based on four different biomass burning emission inventories, we found that biomass burning emissions could lead to a global CO2 concentration increase of 2.4 ppm annually. Africa contributed the largest global CO2 emissions among all continental regions, where the maximum CO2 concentration increase could reach 7.9–13.0 ppm in summer. Model evaluation results showed that simulation using the Quick Fire Emissions Database (QFED) as the model priori biomass burning emission inventory had the best performance compared with the satellite and surface observations. The sensitivity of simulated CO2 concentrations to the uncertainties in different biomass burning emission inventories was high in southern South America and most areas of the Eurasian continent, and low in central Africa and Southeast Asia.

In this study, we use the observation and WRF-Chem (Weather Research and Forecasting Model with Chemistry) simulation to analyze the factors affecting the removal efficiency in a continuous fog and haze episode from November 26 to 28, 2018 in Jiangsu Province, such as fog thickness and duration. The results show that the WRF-Chem simulation well reproduces the boundary layer characteristics in the stages of fog formation, development and dissipation. The atmospheric boundary layer provides favorable conditions for the maintenance of fog and air pollution. The inversion layer, with the maximum intensity of 3 °C per 100 m, creates favorable thermal conditions, and the water vapor advection is also conducive to the fog maintenance. The ground observation verifies the wet scavenging of PM2.5 during dense fog events. The scavenging effect is related to the fog duration, and the correlation is positive when the fog is just formed and negative when the fog is dissipating. The PM2.5 concentration decreases from 159 μg m−3 to 38 μg m−3 after the fog lasts for 11 h. The fog has a remarkable scavenging effect on PM2.5 in the vertical direction, due to the deposition effect of fog droplets on the pollutant particles. The PM2.5 concentration on the ground is lower than the vertical average in the fog area, and the scavenging effects during the dense fog periods on November 27 and 28 are 47.7 μg m−3 and 36.1 μg m−3, respectively. The fog duration is mostly concentrated in 3–17 h. When the duration of fog is 4–8 h, the scavenging effect on PM2.5 reaches the strongest, with an average PM2.5 concentration decrease of &gt;70 μg m−3. © 2023","Air pollution; Fog; Model simulation; Wet scavenging; WRF-Chem","Air pollution; Atmospheric chemistry; Fog; Particles (particulate matter); River pollution; Chemistry simulations; Dense fog; Modeling simulation; Particulate Matter; PM 2.5; Scavenging effect; Weather research and forecasting model with chemistry; Weather research and forecasting models; Wet scavenging; Yangtze river delta; Weather forecasting; advection; atmospheric pollution; boundary layer; dissipation; fog; observational method; particulate matter; scavenging (chemistry); simulation; water vapor; advection; air pollution; article; boundary layer; China; haze; particulate matter; particulate matter 2.5; predictive model; river; simulation; thickness; water vapor; weather; China; Yangtze River"

However, as motion and noise artifacts continue to pose manifold challenges toward the task of remote estimation of this signal (popularly known as rPPG), an authentic approximation of rPPG signals is of immense interest and convenience. In this work, we present a self-supervised learning-based regression framework that can reliably estimate the heart rate by accurately approximating a PPG signal from a participant's videos with sufficient coverage of their skin regions, in the presence of different types of local noises. The idea is that the PPG signals generated from the different parts of an individual will be nearly identical, while these signals from two different individuals may be comparably different. Though the severity of difference may vary based on the variance in their health conditions. Motivated by this intuition, we augment an rPPG signal extracted from a given facial landmark of an individual, using various other rPPG signals extracted from the neighboring facial landmarks of the same individual, to align their unique personalized patterns. Specifically, we develop a robust Similarity-aware PPG (SimPPG) based heart-rate estimation scheme that adopts the instance discrimination method within a self-supervised learning setting to perform two-fold objectives: (1) discriminating every positive pair (rPPGs from different local skin regions of a given individual) from all negative pairs (rPPGs from different local skin regions of different individuals in a batch); (2) enforcing the alignments in the individual's respective heart-rate predictions with that of the corresponding ground truth PPG signals in parallel. Experiments using the large-scale UBFC-Phys dataset and our in-house data collection not only show a remarkable performance of SimPPG (MAEhr=1.89bpm, which is 77% improvement compared to the existing baseline and MSE=2.91 in approximating the PPG signal), but also show its effectiveness in terms of handling various skin features across demographics. In a limited data environment, SimPPG is reported to have used only a random 75% of the available training collection to attain a competitive performance compared to several state-of-the-art models. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.","Evaluation; Heart-rate estimation; Instance discrimination; Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) approximation; Self-supervised learning","adult; article; case report; clinical article; demographics; face; female; heart rate; human; human experiment; intuition; learning; male; noise; photoelectric plethysmography; prediction; skin; videorecording"

In recent years, everolimus (EVL) has emerged as a potential alternative to standard tacrolimus (TAC) as the primary immunosuppressant to prevent rejection that may also reduce the risk of cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV), chronic kidney disease (CKD) and cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection. However, the 2 regimens have never been compared head-to-head in a randomized trial. The study design and rationale are reviewed in light of the challenges inherent in rare disease research. Methods: The TEAMMATE trial (IND 127980) is the first multicenter randomized clinical trial (RCT) in pediatric HT. The primary purpose is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of EVL and low-dose TAC (LD-TAC) compared to standard-dose TAC and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF). Children aged &lt;21 years at HT were randomized (1:1 ratio) at 6 months post-HT to either regimen, and followed for 30 months. Children with recurrent rejection, multi-organ transplant recipients, and those with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) &lt;30 mL/min/1.73m2 were excluded. The primary efficacy hypothesis is that, compared to TAC/MMF, EVL/LD-TAC is more effective in preventing 3 MATEs: acute cellular rejection (ACR), CKD and CAV. The primary safety hypothesis is that EVL/LD-TAC does not have a higher cumulative burden of 6 MATEs (antibody mediated rejection [AMR], infection, and post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder [PTLD] in addition to the 3 above). The primary endpoint is the MATE score, a composite, ordinal surrogate endpoint reflecting the frequency and severity of MATEs that is validated against graft loss. The study had a target sample size of 210 patients across 25 sites and is powered to demonstrate superior efficacy of EVL/LD-TAC. Trial enrollment is complete and participant follow-up will be completed in 2023. Conclusion: The TEAMMATE trial is the first multicenter RCT in pediatric HT. It is anticipated that the study will provide important information about the safety and efficacy of everolimus vs tacrolimus-based regimens and will provide valuable lessons into the design and conduct of future trials in pediatric HT © 2023 Elsevier Inc.",,

Using India Human Development Survey panel (2005 & 2011–12) data, we find that children from disadvantaged groups (such as SCs and STs) have significantly lesser chances of education continuation, post enrolment. The level of early reading and math scores are positively and significantly associated with the likelihood of students’ education continuation.

Meanwhile, the western United States, particularly the coastal areas from Washington to California, received much less precipitation than normal during early 2020. Is it possible that this reduction in precipitation was driven by the reduced aerosols due to the coronavirus? Here we show that the reduction in aerosols resulted in higher temperatures (up to ∼0.5 °C) and generally lower snow amounts but cannot explain the observed low precipitation amounts over this region. In addition to an assessment of the effects of the coronavirus-related reduction in aerosols on precipitation across the western United States, our findings also provide basic information on the potential impacts different mitigation efforts aimed at reducing anthropogenic aerosols would have on the regional climate. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","Aerosols; COVID-19; Precipitation; Temperature; Western United States; WRF-Chem","Aerosols; Air quality; % reductions; California; Coastal area; Condition; Coronaviruses; Highest temperature; Potential impacts; Washington; Western United States; WRF/Chem; COVID-19"

Combining the CRE visit records with administrative student data, I find that CRE leads to 0.02–0.03 of a standard deviation increase in statewide English Language Arts test scores among low-income students one year after the visit and find suggestive evidence that CRE improves the math scores for subgroups of students in poverty. In particular, the CRE effect varies based on locality and access to reading materials, with a larger effect on students residing in metropolitan areas or close to public libraries.

Background: Allophylus africanus P. Beauv is a medicinal plant commonly used in sub-Sahara Africa for the treatment of metabolic disorders and infectious diseases. Objective: The objective of the study was to isolate and characterize anti-hyperglycemic and anti-hyperlipidemic chemical constituents from Allophylus africanus, and to investigate the mechanism of their enzymatic inhibitions. Methods: The chemical constituents were isolated using various column chromatographic tech-niques. The anti-hyperlipidemic and anti-hyperglycemic properties of the chemical constituents were investigated by measuring their inhibitory effects on porcine pancreatic lipase and α-glucosidase enzymes. Fluorescence quenching constants obtained from Stern−Volmer plots were used to determine the mechanisms of inhibitory action. Results: Twelve compounds, of which three were new peptide alkaloids, ethylamino asperphena-mate (10), allophylane (11) and allophyline (12), were isolated. The new peptide alkaloids and asperphenamate (9) inhibited porcine pancreatic lipase in a dose-dependent manner with IC50 &lt; 90 µM. Also, 9, 12, stigmasta-5, 22-dien-3-O-β-D-glucoside (3) and eudesmenol (5) inhibited α-glucosidase enzymes with IC50 &lt; 165 µM, which was lower than that of standard drug, acarbose (432.16 ± 6.52 µM). From the Stern-Volmer plots, 9 and 10 indicated a static quenching, while 11 and 12 suggested the occurrence of both static and dynamic quenching mechanisms on porcine pancreatic lipase. On α-glucosidase, only 12 exhibited a concurrent static and dynamic quenching mechanism. Conclusion: The anti-diabesity compounds obtained from A. africanus established its potential for the treatment of metabolic disorders.

However, their applications in some specific fields, such as chem-/biosensing remain hampered due to their inherent instability to different external stimuli. Herein, we discover a novel mechanism that ethanol, a chemical that is generally thought to be detrimental to PNCs, could specifically initiate the in-situ crystallization of the precursor salts absorbed by paper fiber to yield standard CsPbBr3 fluorescent PNCs. Based on systematical experimental verification, it is revealed that ethanol could mediate the interfacial interaction of the PNC precursor salts on the paper fiber to allow for this exceptional in-situ PNC crystallization process. Accordingly, a fluorescence turn-on mode paper sensor for rapid and high-sensitive expiratory alcohol detection is designed, which could fulfill the on-site visualized drink-driving screening requirement. Furthermore, the application of this new mechanism in multidimensional information encryption is also demonstrated.

When the probe interacts with the sample, the light is diffracted and a diffraction pattern is detected. Then the sample (or probe) is shifted laterally in space to illuminate a new area of the sample whilst ensuring sufficient overlap. Similarly, in Fourier ptychography a sample is illuminated at different angles of incidence (effectively shifting the sample’s Fourier transform) after which a lens acts as a low-pass filter, thereby effectively providing localized Fourier information about the sample around frequencies dictated by each angle of illumination. Mathematically, one therefore obtains a similar set of overlapping measurements of the sample in both Fourier ptychography and ptychography, except in the different domains (Fourier for the former, and physical for the latter). In either case, one is then able to reconstruct an image of the sample from the measurements using similar methods. Near-Field (Fourier) Ptychography (NFP) (see, e.g., Stockmar et al. (Sci Rep 3(1):1–6, 2013), Stockmar et al. (Phys Rev Appl 3(1): 014005, 2015) and Zhang et al. (Optics Exp 27(5): 7498–7512, 2019)) occurs when the sample is placed at a short defocus distance having a large Fresnel number. In this paper, we prove that certain NFP measurements are robustly invertible (up to an unavoidable global phase ambiguity) for specific Point Spread Functions (PSFs) and physical masks which lead to well-conditioned lifted linear systems. We then apply a block phase retrieval algorithm using weighted angular synchronization and prove that the proposed approach accurately recovers the measured sample for these specific PSF and mask pairs. Finally, we also propose using a Wirtinger Flow for NFP problems and numerically evaluate that alternate approach both against our main proposed approach, as well as with NFP measurements for which our main approach does not apply. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Fourier ptychography; Inverse problems; Near-field ptychography; Phase retrieval; Weighted angular synchronization; Wirtinger flow",

Quantitative data on changes in hunting skills in indigenous communities driven by education, employment, and other lifestyle changes are lacking. Here we assess hunting skills of young people in Papua New Guinea (PNG). We use a sample of 7818 secondary school students, representing 15% of the most educated individuals in their age cohort. Students self-assessed their hunting skills as none (34% of respondents), poor (46%), and good (20%). Male students reported significantly higher hunting skills than female students. Hunting skills were positively correlated with knowledge of local bird species and with other traditional skills (growing food, using medicinal plants, building houses). They were negatively correlated with math and English skills, as well as with the transportation accessibility of the village/town where the students grew up. Students who grow up in town reported significantly lower hunting skills than those who grew up in village. These results show that students' hunting skills are already low, and the trends in their socio-cultural drivers predict a further decline in the future. The increasing disconnection from the natural environment and the declining attractiveness of hunting as prestigious activity for the young and educated people are part of a broader trend of loss of ethnobiological knowledge in PNG's indigenous communities. While it may reduce hunting pressure on some endangered species, it may also remove traditional incentives for conservation in rainforest-dwelling communities. © 2023 The Authors","Biodiversity conservation; Education; Ethnobiological knowledge; Hunting skills; Indigenous communities; Tropical forests",

It now features online detector data acquisition, high-throughput data dumping and enhanced real-time data processing capabilities. The achieved low-latency real-time data processing extends the application of ultrafast electron beam X-ray computed tomography (UFXCT) scanners to real-time scanner control and process control. We implemented high performance data packet reception based on data plane development kit (DPDK) and high-throughput data storing using both hierarchical data format version 5 (HDF5) as well as the adaptable input/output system version 2 (ADIOS2). Furthermore, we extended RISA's underlying pipelining framework to support the fork-join paradigm. This allows for more complex workflows as it is necessary, e.g. for online data processing. Also, the pipeline configuration is moved from compile-time to runtime, i.e. processing stages and their interconnections can now be configured using a configuration file. In several benchmarks, RISA is profiled regarding data acquisition performance, data storage throughput and overall processing latency. We found that using direct IO mode significantly improves data writing performance on the local data storage. We could further prove that RISA is now capable of concurrently receiving, processing and storing data from up to 768 detector channels (3072 MB/s) at 8000 fps on a single-GPU computer in real-time.

Phys. Commun. 219 (2017) 353-360 [1] Does the new version supersede the previous version?: Yes. Reasons for the new version: Extended capabilities for real-time operation with latest UFXCT hardware. Summary of revisions: (i) Add forking and joining of processing pipeline branches (ii) Add runtime (re-)configuration of pipeline stages and connections (iii) Add UDP receiver stage to acquire detector data in real-time (iv) Add high-throughput data dumping Nature of problem: Ultrafast electron beam X-ray computed tomography scanners stream multiple Gigabytes of raw data per second via Ethernet to a control computer. Receiving the data with low latency, real-time image-based control would become possible. For this, data need to be captured from the network, stored on disk, reconstructed and post-processed concurrently. The current total data rate of up to 3072 MB/s requires high-throughput solutions for each of these tasks. Solution method: Using a pipeline scheme, RISA processes incoming raw data in distinct stages (sources, processors, sinks). These are implemented in GPU kernels and are executed concurrently to exploit data parallelism as well as task parallelism. To capture detector data, we implemented a UDP packet capturing stage based on DPDK [2] which acts as a source stage. By allowing the pipeline to fork up into multiple branches, we concurrently acquire, store and process the data. For storing these data, we use the HDF5 format [3]. We achieve the required data rates by writing in direct IO mode onto an SSD array in RAID 0 configuration. Additional comments including restrictions and unusual features: RISA provides a set of general-purpose processing stages which are suitable for generic image stream processing.

Using the data on firms' green innovation achievement and environmental protection investment from China, where the information of D&O Insurance purchases was disclosed, we find robust evidence that insured firms significantly promote firms' environmental responsibility-taking, evident in more green innovation achievement and environmental protection investment. This positive association is more pronounced for firms exposed to stronger environmental regulation. In addition, we document that the moderating effect of environmental regulation is stronger for SOEs, firms with better corporate governance, operating in heavy-polluting industries, and exposed to a stronger institutional environment. Further mechanism analysis shows that public supervision is the underlying channel through which D&O Insurance affects firms' environmental responsibility. Overall, our findings imply that D&O Insurance, one of the important corporate governance mechanisms, motivates directors and officers to actively practice firms' environmental responsibility, and environmental regulation exerts a positive influence over this governance effect. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","D&O insurance; Environmental regulation; Firms' environmental responsibility","environmental policy; environmental protection; innovation; insurance system; investment; liability; regulatory approach; China"

This work aims to study Kombucha fermentation in yerba mate infusion to maximise cellulose production and its processing for film formulation. Yerba mate infusion with sucrose resulted in an extraordinary substrate for Kombucha fermentation with an optimised cellulose production of 19.4 g/l and 0.29 g/g of yield. Filmogenic dispersions were analysed in terms of rheology and particle size distribution. Microscopic characterisation of films exhibited homogeneous surfaces. The addition of glycerol, as well as the solids from the fermented broth, resulted in a significant increase in hydration and a reduction in elastic modulus, ultimate tensile strength and glass transition temperature of the films. The results revealed that the formulation containing the Kombucha fermented media showed similar properties to the glycerol plasticised material. This could be considered a novel result as it may replace the use of traditional plasticisers. Bioactive compounds from yerba mate provided an antioxidant activity greater than 95% of ABTS radical inhibition to cellulosic material, demonstrating that natural bioactive cellulose-based films are materials that potentially protect food products against oxidation. © 2023","Antioxidant activity; Bacterial cellulose; Food packaging; Ilex paraguariensis; Polyphenols; SCOBY",

The electronic stopping power is computed from the corrected Bethe formula, with the shell correction derived from numerical calculations with the plane-wave Born approximation (PWBA) for atoms, which were based on an independent-electron model with the Dirac–Hartree–Fock–Slater self-consistent potential for the ground-state configuration of the target atom. The density effect correction is evaluated from an empirical optical oscillator strength (OOS) model based on atomic subshell contributions obtained from PWBA calculations. For projectiles heavier than the electron, the Barkas correction is evaluated from the OOS model, and the Lindhard–Sørensen correction is estimated from an accurate parameterization of its numerical values. The calculated electronic stopping power is completely determined by a single empirical parameter, the mean excitation energy or I value of the material. The radiative stopping power for electrons, and positrons, is evaluated by means of Seltzer and Berger's cross section tables for bremsstrahlung emission. The program yields reliable stopping powers and particle ranges for arbitrary materials and projectiles with kinetic energy larger than a certain cutoff value Ecut, which is specific of each projectile kind. The program is accompanied by an extensive database that contains tables of relevant energy-dependent atomic quantities for all the elements from hydrogen to einsteinium. sbethe may be used to generate basic information for dosimetry calculations and Monte Carlo simulations of radiation transport, and as a pedagogical tool. Program summary: Program title: SBETHE CPC Library link to program files: https://doi.org/10.17632/7zw25f428t.1 Licensing provisions: CC by NC 3.0 Programming language: Fortran 90/95 Nature of problem: The program calculates the stopping power of arbitrary materials for swift charged projectiles with small charges. The material is characterized by its chemical composition, mass density, and the empirical I value. The considered projectiles are electrons, positrons, negative muons, antimuons, protons, antiprotons, and alphas, which are described as point particles characterized by their mass and charge. If the actual I value of the material is known, the results from the program are expected to be reliable for projectiles with kinetic energy higher than a value Ecut, of the order of 1 keV for electrons and positrons, 150 keV for muons and antimuons, 0.75 MeV for protons and antiprotons, and 5 MeV for alpha particles. Solution method: The electronic stopping power is calculated by means of a corrected Bethe formula [1], which combines the conventional Bethe logarithm with the following corrections, 1) the shell correction obtained from calculations based on the plane-wave Born approximation with the self-consistent Dirac–Hartree–Fock–Slater (DHFS) potential of neutral atoms in their ground-state configuration [2], 2) the density effect correction, which accounts for the reduction of the stopping power caused by the dielectric polarization of the medium, 3) a parameterization of the Lindhard–Sørensen correction, which generalizes the Bloch correction for relativistic projectiles, and 4) the Barkas correction, which accounts for differences between the stopping powers of particles and their antiparticles. The density-effect and the Barkas corrections are calculated from a model of the optical oscillator strength (OOS) of the material, which combines the contributions of inner atomic subshells calculated with the DHFS potential, with a classical oscillator model for the contribution of valence electrons, A simple extrapolation formula is used to extend the calculated electronic stopping power to energies less than Ecut to allow the calculation of particle ranges. For electrons and positrons, the radiative stopping power is calculated from numerical tables prepared by Seltzer and Berger [3]. Additional comments including restrictions and unusual features: The calculated stopping power is determined by a single parameter, the mean excitation energy or I value. The program assigns to each material a default I value, derived from the recommendations in the ICRU Report 37, which can be changed by the user. The distribution package includes text files with tables of atomic energy-dependent quantities (subshell optical oscillator strengths, shell corrections, scaled cross sections for bremsstrahlung emission) that are used in the calculations.

In our previous work, we presented a practical solution to this problem, where quasi-linear efficiency, both in time and memory, was obtained by utilizing the fast Fourier transform. Here, we present an updated version of our highly-parallelized computer program, named Coulombo-Lattice, that eliminates the necessity of introducing an auxiliary basis set for the wave-function transfer to the computational grid. Here, we instead exploit the properties of the underlying crystal lattice and run calculations on a regular three-dimensional grid superimposed on the original, lower-symmetry lattice. Due to removal of spurious interactions from other supercells, the resulting Coulomb matrix elements are, up to numerical precision, identical to those obtained by the direct summation O(N2) method, yet our code maintains O(Nlog⁡N) scaling. We illustrate our approach by calculations involving up to 1.7 million integrals, and number of atoms reaching up to 2.8 million, for the problem of dopant charging energy for a single phosphorus dopant embedded in a silicon lattice. Next, to emphasize the broad applicability of our code, we show the results for mixed zinc-blend/wurtzite lattice systems, also known as crystal phase quantum dots. Program summary: Program Title: Coulombo-Lattice Licensing provisions: CC BY 4.0 Programming language: C++ Nature of the problem (approx. 50-250 words): Computing the Coulomb matrix elements (Coulomb and exchange integrals), while being a demanding computational task, is a necessary step in a range of quantum mechanical calculations. For example, in the field of nanostructures, such as quantum dots and nanowires or novel single dopant devices, this stage of calculation (even after a series of approximations) is at least an O(N2) operation (a summation over all pairs of N atoms or grid points in the analyzed system). Moreover, calculating the full Coulomb matrix usually requires the computation of thousands of such elements, thus presenting a formidable computational challenge. Solution method (approx. 50-250 words): We provide a ready-to-use implementation for calculating Coulomb matrix elements for a given set of input wavefunctions in LCAO (linear combination of atomic orbitals) form resulting from tight-binding calculation. This implementation is based on the approach introduced in [1,2], by using a fast Fourier transform. In this work, we further significantly improved the method by eliminating the need to introduce wave-function transfer via auxiliary basis set.

Improving the accuracy order or reducing the dissipation of the WENO by optimizing the linear weights can effectively improve the resolution of this scheme in the smooth regions. However, under the same method, the improvement of shock-capturing abilities is generally limited and may lead to numerical oscillations. In order to simultaneously improve the resolution in discontinuous regions and ensure the performance of the smooth regions, this study uses the shock detector to combine the tangent of hyperbola for interface capturing (THINC) scheme, which is a better discontinuity-capturing scheme, with a given WENO discretization, such as the improved fast WENO (IFWENO) scheme that equips with high economy and does not loss accuracy at any critical point. The hybrid method in this study is an apriori algorithm, which is more efficient and universal than the method in (Takagi et al. J. Comput. Phys. 452(2022)110899). Additionally, the performance of the THINC scheme in different regions near the discontinuity is analyzed in detail through numerical experiments, and a shock detector that can fully exploit the advantages of the THINC scheme is provided. By using this shock detector, several one-dimensional and two-dimensional numerical cases are employed to verify that the hybrid scheme can greatly improve the performance in discontinuities without affecting the flow structure in the smooth regions, which proves the effectiveness of the proposed shock detector and the excellence of the hybrid IFWENO-THINC scheme. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.","Hybrid scheme; Shock capturing; Shock detector; THINC; WENO","Essentially non-oscillatory; Essentially non-oscillatory schemes; Hybrid scheme; Interface capturing scheme; Performance; Shock detectors; Shock-capturing; Smooth regions; Tangent of hyperbola for interface capturing; Weighted essentially non-oscillatory; Numerical methods"

The response is calculated by implementing the finite amplitude method for relativistic quasiparticle random phase approximation. In the new version, we have implemented the following features: (i) meson-exchange interactions, (ii) low-rank method for calculating induced densities and currents, (iii) generalized minimal residual method (GMRES), (iv) evaluation of the nucleon localization function, (v) extraction of the QRPA transition matrix elements and eigenfrequencies, (vi) evaluation of the H11 part of the induced Hamiltonian, (vii) multipole excitation operators up to J≤5 are now included. Program summary: Program title: DIRQFAM v2.0.0 CPC Library link to program files: https://doi.org/10.17632/6gv8nxg4ns.2 Licensing provisions: GPLv3 Programming language: Fortran 90. External routines/libraries: BLAS/LAPACK, version 3.1. or higher. Journal reference of previous version: A. Bjelčić, T. Nikšić, Comp. Phys. Comm. 253, 107184 (2020). Does the new version supersede the previous version?: Yes Nature of problem: Multipole response of deformed even-even open-shell nuclei can be calculated using the quasiparticle finite amplitude method (QFAM), based on the relativistic self-consistent mean-field models. The particle-hole channel is described by a zero-range relativistic effective interaction or interaction based on meson exchange, while the particle-particle channel of the effective inter-nucleon interaction is described by a separable finite-range pairing force. The method can be applied to perform systematic studies of collective modes even in heavy deformed nuclei. Solution method: The current implementation computes the multipole response by solving the QFAM equations in a self-consistent iteration scheme. At each iteration the QFAM solutions are updated using the GMRES method. The QFAM amplitudes are expanded in the simplex-y harmonic oscillator basis. Summary of revisions: 1. meson-exchange interaction are included in the code; 2. calculation of the nucleon localization function; 3. extraction of the QRPA transition matrix elements and eigenfrequencies; 4. evaluation of the H11 part of the induced Hamiltonian; 5. multipoles excitation operators up to J≤5 are included; 6. low-rank method for calculating induced densities and currents; 7. generalized minimal residual method; 8. dynamic memory allocation; 9. reduced memory requirements; Additional comments including restrictions and unusual features: Open-shell even-even nuclei with parity conserved axially symmetric ground states are considered.

Previous studies on the prawn reported a similar level of genetic diversity in both hatchery and wild populations, although it is believed that a small number of brooders are generally carried out in hatcheries. Here, thirteen microsatellite loci were used to observe and characterize the genetic diversity in hatchery and wild populations of the prawn. These microsatellite loci were also used to investigate the prawn mate choice. Two experiments of mate choice were done in 1000-liter tanks containing 48 mating partners from four different broodstocks. Newly hatched larvae were daily observed and used for parental analysis to reveal their parents as successful mating pairs. The instinctive mate choice that occurred in the mating tanks was thus disclosed for the first time. The level of genetic diversity, including the allelic richness and observed and expected heterozygosities, was shown not to significantly differ among hatchery and wild populations (P > 0.05). Based on the analysis of pairwise relatedness among mating partners and internal relatedness of larvae, the prawn prefers to mate with partners from different broodstock. Evidently, the internal relatedness of larvae according to the successful mating pairs was significantly lower than in the random mating scenario (P < 0.01). This mating instinct is hypothesized to be important for sustaining genetic diversity in populations of the prawn. This is the first report on inbreeding avoidance of giant freshwater prawn. Future studies on how prawn can recognize partners from different broodstocks are awaiting. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","Genetic relatedness; Inbreeding avoidance; Microsatellite; Non-random mating; Parentage analysis",

Mitochondrial DNA was extracted using ammonium acetate method. The PCR reaction was performed using a primer pair of the nucleotide sequences of the mitochondrial COI gene and its PCR products were sequenced. Out of the 13 haplotypes identified through evaluating the sequences, one haplotype was common within the sampling areas. The mean haplotype diversity was high (0.762±0.044) and the mean nucleotide diversity was low (0.003±0.0003). The longest genetic distance of 0.243 (P<0.05) was observed between the samples collected from Chabahar and Bushehr and the lowest of −0.048 (P>0.05) between the samples collected from Bandar Abbas and Bushehr. The mean values of Tajima's D and Fu's Fs were respectively calculated as −0.232 and 0.485 (P>0.05).

The present findings suggested, probably the population of yellowtail scad in Chabahar constitutes a independent gene pool of other regions, and despite the unity of the populations of Bandar Abbas and Bushehr, their molecular diversity is acceptable.

Owen (Math Program 9:358–370, 1975) presents an allocation scheme for the joint profit of the firms through the cooperative game defined by formulating linear programming problems for obtaining optimal production planning. However, since the values of the resources are measured by the shadow prices which are the optimal dual solution to the linear programming problem for the grand coalition, the excess resources in the grand coalition have no value, and players receive no payoff for the excess resources possessed. Moreover, even when some coalitions cannot be formed, the Owen solution does not change and it is not affected by such situations because it is calculated using the optimal dual solution in the linear production planning problem only for the grand coalition. To cope with these difficulties, we revise the definition of the linear production game by introducing a characteristic function taking into account not only the maximized profit but also the value of the excess resources. To the revised linear production game, we introduce a solution concept with the following favorable aspects. (i) The shadow prices of the resources for all coalitions are utilized for calculating the payoffs of the players. (ii) When some coalitions cannot be formed, such situations are appropriately reflected in the payoffs. (iii) The proposed payoff vector is in the core of the revised linear production game. To demonstrate these properties, we give the numerical examples, and calculate the corresponding proposed payoff vectors.

Executive function, as an essential cognitive ability, is a core cognitive element that supports children’s mathematical processing. However, there have only been a few studies focusing on the effects of each component of executive function on different mathematical abilities (mathematical operation, spatial imagination, and logical thinking). Primary school is the key period during which children acquire basic mathematical ability. However, limited studies have examined the developmental relationships between the various components of executive function and the different mathematical abilities of children at different grade levels. Consequently, the purpose of this study was to examine the role of each component of executive function in the different mathematical abilities of children at different grade levels. A total of 812 children in grades 3, 4, 5, and 6 completed tests covering mathematical operations, spatial imagination, and logical thinking to measure their basic mathematical ability. The Stroop task and the GO/NOGO task were used to measure interference inhibition and response inhibition. Children’s working memory span was assessed using forward and backward digit span tasks. Children’s working memory updating was investigated using simple and difficult digital updating tasks. Children’s cognitive flexibility was examined using digit shifting tasks. Finally, a correlation analysis and a structural equation model (SEM) were used to investigate the impact of each component of executive function on children’s mathematical abilities at different grade levels. The results revealed that working memory was the most important factor affecting children’s mathematical skills, over inhibitory control and cognitive flexibility. Specifically, working memory span was the most statistically significant predictor of ability with respect to mathematical operations, while working memory updating was a stronger predictor of spatial imagination and logical thinking ability from grade 3 to grade 6. In a further analysis of the data, we divided the four grades into two stages, with grades 3 and 4 set as the younger group and grades 5 and 6 set as the older group. The results showed working memory span to be the most important predictor of mathematical operation ability, spatial imagination ability, and logical thinking ability in the junior grades. In the older students, the predictive effect of working memory span on basic math ability dropped, and the effects of working memory updating and cognitive flexibility on basic math ability increased. These results indicate that different components of executive function play various roles in different mathematical abilities in school-age children, and that this pattern of influence appears to change as children progress through the grades. Specifically, the lower-order components of executive function components, specifically working memory span, were found to play an important role in the development of three mathematical abilities in younger students, while the higher-order executive function components, specifically working memory updating and cognitive flexibility, were found to play a more important role in processing mathematical tasks in older students. © 2023, Science Press.

Using sufficient airborne ozone profiles during 2012–2018, this study reveals the tropospheric ozone distributions over four cities located in coastal regions of southern China. The 7-year mean tropospheric ozone profiles in the four cities consistently show a double-maxima profile, with a local maximum at 1 km altitude and the other in the middle-to-upper troposphere. Seasonally, springtime ozone is larger than the annual mean throughout the troposphere, while ozone in summer is high in the middle-to-upper troposphere, leading to largest vertical variations among seasons. Ozone in the middle-to-upper troposphere is lower in autumn than in spring and summer. The winter ozone is characterized with a minimum in the lower troposphere, and low values in the middle-to-upper troposphere, leading to least vertical variations among seasons. We untangle the causes for these complicated vertical ozone variations using the GEOS-Chem model. The tropospheric ozone over southern China is partitioned into locally produced ozone, regionally transported native ozone, imported ozone from outside of China (foreign ozone) and natural stratospheric ozone. The results suggest that the springtime ozone abundance is due to the enhanced import of foreign and stratospheric ozone and the intensified regional transport processes of native ozone. In summer, local ozone production is enhanced and regional transport of ozone in the middle-to-upper troposphere is strengthened due to upward air motions, while such transport becomes weaker in autumn leaving low ozone in the middle-to-upper troposphere. In winter, the intensive westerly jets promote foreign and stratospheric ozone again in the middle-to-upper troposphere, but the local ozone production and regional transport are sharply reduced, resulting in low ozone near the surface. This study provides new insights into regional ozone profiles and reveals the significance of vertical ozone variations on surface ozone prevention strategy. © 2023 The Authors","GEOS-Chem; IAGOS; Southern China; Tropospheric ozone variations","Atmospheric chemistry; Coastal zones; Ozone layer; Troposphere; GEOS-chem; IAGOS; Ozone variation; Regional transport; Southern China; Stratospheric ozone; Tropospheric ozone; Tropospheric ozone variation; Upper troposphere; Vertical variation; Ozone; atmospheric pollution; coastal zone; EOS; ozone; seasonality; stratosphere; troposphere; China"

Purified LdSerRS was found to be enzymatically active and exhibited more alpha helices in secondary structure. The enzymatic activity of purified protein was observed as highest near physiological temperature and pH. Mutation in ATP binding residues (R295 and E297) demonstrated reduction in the affinity for cofactor with no significant deviation in secondary structure.

The identified compound presented competitive mode of inhibition for LdSerRS and also revealed druglikeness along with very low toxicity for human macrophages. Structural analysis of protein and ligand complex depicted the binding of Comp 5l into the cofactor binding site of LdSerRS with high affinity succeeded by validation employing molecular dynamics simulations.

Offspring from both control and inflammatory dams were subsequently given chow diet and water ad libitum, without any challenge, for metabolic and behavioral tests. Key findings: Male offspring derived from inflammatory mothers (Inf-F1) maintained on the chow diet developed impaired glucose tolerance and hepatic ectopic fat deposition. Hepatic transcriptome sequencing showed the largest gene changes related to the metabolic pathway. Moreover, Inf-F1 mice exhibited anxiety- and depressive-like behaviors and were accompanied by higher serum corticosterone concentration and lower glucocorticoid receptor abundance in the hippocampus.

While the importance of measuring PM2.5 has been demonstrated, doing so remotely remains challenging. In this study, methodologies for the assessment of aerosol PM2.5 and chemical composition based on a combination of regional and global models and active remote sensing were evaluated against surface observations from the KORUS-AQ campaign. The model outputs from the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) and GEOS-Chem were used and were available at the KORUS-AQ campaign data archive. For remote sensing, aerosol extinction and derived aerosol types available from NASA Langley Airborne Differential Absorption Lidar (DIAL)/High Spectral Resolution Lidar (HSRL) flying onboard DC-8 aircraft were used. A revised version of the algorithm, which incorporates size-specific aerosol dry mass extinction efficiencies for sulfate, nitrate, and ammonia as well as organic matter, is also presented. The PM2.5 concentration estimates were compared with measurements taken at the ground stations. The estimated mean absolute error between the ground station measurements and the remote-sensing-based methodologies was significantly lower compared to the models. The data analysis has shown that uncertainties in relative humidity values, the presence of particles larger than 2.5 μm in diameter, and the abundance of black carbon and organic matter in Asian aerosol were unlikely to explain the differences between measured and predicted surface PM2.5. Local meteorology was found to play a key role influencing the spatiotemporal variability of aerosols and the most important factor determining the agreement between the estimated and ground site-measured PM2.5. The lowest mean absolute error was found for the May 1–16 period, when aerosols were well mixed within the mixing layer and homogeneous across the temporal (1 h) and spatial (8 km) scales used in this study. Under these conditions, the methodologies presented here could give reasonable estimates of PM2.5 concentration and derived chemical composition over South Korea when HSRL data are available. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Aerosol chemical composition; Aerosol type; CATCH; CMAQ; GEOS-Chem; HSRL; PM2.5; Remote sensing","Air quality; Ammonia; Biogeochemistry; NASA; Optical radar; Particle size analysis; Remote sensing; Spectral resolution; Sulfur compounds; Uncertainty analysis; Aerosol chemical composition; Aerosol types; CATCH; Chemical compositions; Community multi-scale air qualities; Differential absorptions lidars; GEOS-chem; High-spectral-resolution lidar; PM 2.5; Remote-sensing; Aerosols; ammonia; ammonium sulfate; black carbon; nitrate; nitric acid; organic matter; sulfate; aerodynamics; aerosol composition; aircraft; algorithm; black carbon; concentration (composition); methodology; particulate matter; remote sensing; aerosol; air pollution; air quality; aircraft; algorithm; Article; boundary layer; chemical composition; dry mass; dust; environmental parameters; environmental temperature; humidity; light scattering; mean absolute error; meteorology; particle size; particulate matter; particulate matter 2.5; relative humidity; remote sensing; South Korea; surface property; troposphere; South Korea"

The two open-pit mines have been expanding their mining production scale since 2005, with frequent mining activities; and the expansion of the pits and the discharge of solid waste will undoubtedly increase the land use and cause the destruction of vegetation. Therefore, we plan to visualize the change in vegetation cover in Dexing City from 2005 to 2020 and the expansion of the two open-pit mines by calculating changes of the Fractional Vegetation Cover (FVC) in the mining area using remote sensing technology.

Although the implementation of air pollution control strategies in recent years has alleviated PM2.5 pollution, O3 pollution and the synergistic pollution of PM2.5 and O3 have become more serious. To understand the underlying chemical interaction mechanisms between PM2.5 and O3, we applied the modified Weather Research and Forecasting model with Chemistry (WRF-Chem) to study the effects of aerosol-photolysis feedback and heterogeneous reactions on the two pollutants and revealed the contribution of different mechanisms in different seasons and regions in Yangtze River Delta (YRD) in eastern China. We found that, through the aerosol-photolysis feedback, PM2.5 decreased the surface photolysis rates JNO2 and JO1D, resulting in a decrease in O3 concentration in the VOC-sensitive area and a slight increase in the NOx-sensitive area. The heterogeneous reactions reduced O3 concentration in the YRD in spring, autumn and winter by consuming HxOy. While in summer, the heterogeneous absorption of NOx decreased O3 in the NOx-sensitive areas and increased O3 in the VOC-sensitive areas. Heterogeneous reactions also promoted the secondary formation of fine sulfate and nitrate aerosols, especially in winter. Through the combined effect of two chemical processes, PM2.5 can lead to a decrease in O3 concentration of −3.3 ppb (−7.6 %), −2.2 ppb (−4.0 %), −2.9 ppb (−6.3 %), and − 5.9 ppb (−18.7 %), in spring, summer, autumn and winter in YRD. Therefore, if the PM2.5 concentration decreases, the weakening effect of PM2.5 on the ozone concentration will be reduced, resulting in the aggravation of ozone pollution.

Am. Chem. Soc. 143 (2021) 12715–12724], which opened a new chapter in the field of ESIPT. Based on density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT), the proton transfer processes of 3NTF in toluene, dichloromethane and acetonitrile were studied. By optimizing the structure of the ground (S0) state and first excited (S1) state of 3NTF in different solvents, the hydrogen-bond parameters and proton-transfer potential energy curves were calculated. It was shown that although photo-excitation enhanced the intramolecular hydrogen bonding strength and thus promoted the occurrence of ESIPT, the solvent polarities inhibited the enhancement of the hydrogen bond of S1 state, which was not conducive to ESIPT. The electron spectra analyses were consistent with experimental data, which confirmed the rationality of molecular configurations. The time-evolved excited state dynamics simulation was performed based on the optimized structure of 3NTF, indicating that the ESIPT was an ultrafast photochemical reaction less than 180 fs. Moreover, we compared the potential energy surfaces of ESIPT, electronic structures based on natural transition orbitals (NTOs) method and electron-hole isosurfaces for the 3NTF and the traditional flavone molecule (3NHF), concluded that the unusually large Stokes shift fluorescence of 3NTF was mainly caused by the coupling of ESIPT and twisting intramolecular charge transfer (TICT), and the 3NTF isomer had the more nπ* character in the electron transition process. The nπ* ICT significantly increased with the decrease of solvent polarities, affecting the molecular photophysical properties, this made it more widely used in biomedical, photochemical, materials science and other fields. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","Charge transfer; Dual-fluorescent phenomena; Dynamic simulation; Excited state intramolecular thiol proton transfer; Hydrogen bond; Potential energy surface","Density functional theory; Dichloromethane; Electron transitions; Electronic structure; Excited states; Fluorescence; Image enhancement; Molecular physics; Oxygen; Potential energy; Potential energy surfaces; Proton transfer; Quantum chemistry; Rate constants; Solvents; Density-functional-theory; Dual-fluorescent phenomenon; Dynamics simulation; Effect of solvents; Excited state intramolecular thiol proton transfer; Excited-states; Photophysical properties; Potential-energy surfaces; Solvent polarity; Transfer properties; Hydrogen bonds"

Its behavior is often difficult to investigate owing to the limited resolution of meteorological field data and inconsistent model implementations. This study investigated the detailed behavior of 25 combinations of in- and below-cloud wet scavenging models using high-resolution (1 km × 1 km) meteorological input. These combinations were all implemented in the Weather Research and Forecasting-Chemistry model, thereby enabling consistent evaluation. The 1-km-resolution simulations were compared with simulations obtained previously using 3-km-resolution meteorological field data. Results revealed that rainfall of &lt;1 mm/h is critical for simulation accuracy. The 1-km results revealed better representation of rainfall than that revealed by the 3-km results, but with spatiotemporal variability in accuracy. Owing to their sensitivity to rainfall, single-parameter wet deposition models showed improvements in performance in the 1-km simulations relative to that in the 3-km simulations. The multiparameter models showed more robust performance in terms of both simulations, and the Roselle–Mircea model presented the best performance among the 25 models considered. Wind transport showed substantial influence on the removal of atmospheric 137Cs, and it was nonnegligible even during periods in which wet deposition was dominant. The 1-km-resolution simulations effectively reproduced local-scale 137Cs concentrations but with deviations in timing, mainly because of biased wind direction. These findings indicate the necessity for a refined wind and dispersion model for local-scale simulation of 137Cs concentration. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","Below-cloud scavenging; Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant accident; In-cloud scavenging; Online-coupled modeling; Wet deposition; WRF-Chem","Atmospheric chemistry; Atmospheric movements; Deposition; Nuclear energy; Nuclear fuels; Nuclear power plants; Nuclear reactor accidents; Uncertainty analysis; Weather forecasting; Below-cloud; Below-cloud scavenging; Field data; Fukushima Dai-ichi Nuclear Power Plant accidents; In-cloud scavenging; Meteorological fields; Online coupled models; Wet deposition; Wet scavenging; WRF/Chem; Rain; cesium 137; rain; atmospheric transport; cesium isotope; cloud; computer simulation; nuclear accident; rainfall; spatial variation; temporal variation; wet deposition; wind direction; Article; atmosphere; below cloud scavenging model; cloud; concentration (parameter); controlled study; data accuracy; forecasting; Fukushima nuclear accident; in cloud scavenging model; meteorology; model; online system; simulation; weather; wet deposition; wind"

Rev. Lett. 105 155001). The impact of global effects on the radial profile of the plasma density has been investigated in a previous study for a particular TCV discharge with negligible particle source, satisfying the ‘zero particle flux’ (ZPF) condition. A radially local flux-tube analysis, reconstructing the dependence of the peaking of the density profile on the main physical parameters, invoking the ZPF constraint, was pursued close to mid-radius in (Mariani et al 2018 Phys. Plasmas 25 012313). This analysis was followed by a global one (Mariani et al 2019 Plasma Phys. Control. Fusion 61 064005), where local quasi-linear (QL) and nonlinear (NL) results were compared with global simulations, showing small global effects on the density peaking. However, these gradient-driven (GD) global runs considered Krook-type heat and particle sources to keep temperature and density profiles fixed on average, which differ from the experimental radially localized sources. To remove this possible bias on the results, a different evaluation of the density peaking for the same case is performed here, based on global NL hybrid simulations where the temperature profiles are [still] kept fixed with the Krook-type sources, however the density profile relaxes in a flux-driven way (with zero particle source). The new hybrid simulations show a good agreement with the old GD runs. A global QL model is also developed and applied using the output from linear global runs, to estimate ratios of fluxes, showing a good agreement with the flux-tube results of global NL GD simulations. The effect of collisions on the results is also investigated, in order to evaluate their impact on the radial variation of the density peaking. © 2023 The Author(s).

Fluids 13 2593-6) introduced the scalings of adiabatic plasma compression. Basically, if the shape of the external plasma boundary and the aspect ratio are preserved during the compression, then the density, kinetic pressure, beta and current scale respectively as n ∼ C 3 , p ∼ C 5 , B ∼ C 2 , β ∼ C , I t ∼ C , where C is the linear compression ratio, that is, the ratio between initial and final major radii. In this work, we show analytically, by expanding the Grad-Shafranov equation in terms of C, that the deviation to the Furth-Yoshikawa scaling is related to the Shafranov shift that arises when beta increases at large compression ratios. There is an obvious effect of the Shafranov shift because the axis is moved to a region with larger volume element, and an indirect effect, associated to the relation between flux and radius. The latter effect adds to the first, and is of the same order of magnitude. The result is that the pressure increases less than the C 5 scaling, which can have a significant impact on the fusion power achieved at maximum compression. The analytical results are backed up by equilibrium simulations carried out with the CHEASE code. Equilibria are obtained for different values of C, with conservation of the total fluxes, q profile, and entropy of the plasma. The agreement of the theory and simulations is very good when the boundary of the plasma is circular and the aspect ratio small. When the aspect ratio is close to 1, and/or the boundary not circular, the analytical result gives the gist of the reduction of compression. Finally, a pressure anisotropy ( p ⊥ − p ∥ ) / p approximately equal to the increase in normalized Shafranov shift is predicted. © 2023 IOP Publishing Ltd","magnetized target fusion; tokamak adiabatic compression; tokamak equilibrium","Magnetoplasma; Tokamak devices; Adiabatic compression; Analytical results; Aspect-ratio; Magnetized target fusion; Plasma boundary; Plasma compression; Scalings; Shafranov shift; Tokamak adiabatic compression; Tokamak equilibrium; Aspect ratio"

The sky view factor (SVF) is a crucial structure index of buildings and it combines height and density attributes. These attributes have impacts on the air temperature(Tair). However, there are few studies on the association between SVF and Tair across block scales. In this paper, we designed ten scenarios according to the characteristics of Beijing's commercial and residential buildings. Furthermore, we used ENVI-met, a microclimate simulation model, to simulate the Tair in designed scenarios and evaluate the impact of SVF on the Tair of each component. A number of significant observations were noted based on the experimental results: (1) from 10:00 to 17:00, there is a positive correlation between SVF and Tair; from 18:00 to 9:00 the next day, there is a negative correlation between SVF and Tair (2) the relationship between building shadow ratio (BSR) and Tair is not a single negative correlation: at sunrise, BSR is the maximum in a day, but the cooling effect of BSR on Tair is not obvious because of the weak solar radiation. In addition, the arrangement of building directions has a great influence on the relationship between BSR and Tair (3) for the same building scenario, BSR decreases with the increase of SVF (4) the synergistic effect of SVF and BSR on Tair in the daytime can be divided into two periods, the separation time points are 7:00 and 14:00. This study can provide instructions for urban design in optimizing building layout and mitigating the urban heat impact on human health. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","Building shadow ratio; ENVI-met; Simulation; Sky view factors; Urban micro-climate",

Chemical cues in the aquatic environment have an impact on the individual and group behavior of fish, and differences in these behavioral responses might be related to the body size of group members. Here, we used juvenile crucian carp (Carassius carassius) as an animal model to examine the effects of different cues and group mate body sizes on the individual and group behavior of shoaling fish. Three group mate body size (small, large, and mixed size) and three pheromone (rearing tank water, food, and CACs) treatments were combined in our study, with each treatment having 16 groups of five fish. We found that the individual swimming speed of the mixed group increased after injecting rearing water and food cues in the tank. After injecting CACs, the individual swimming speed of both the small and mixed groups increased, while that of the large group did not change. After the injection of CACs, the group speed of the small group was higher than that of the large and mixed groups. After the food cues were added to the tank, the synchronization of speed of the small group was higher than that of the mixed and large groups. Both the interindividual distance and nearest-neighbor distance of the mixed group remained unchanged after injecting CACs.

Mate corneas were recovered into Kerasave or Optisol-GS (27 pairs) and stored at 2°C to 8°C for 14 days. Corneas were evaluated by trained eye bank technicians, and study parameters were compared between the initial and final evaluations. Endothelial cell density (ECD), hexagonality (HEX), and coefficient of variation (CV) were evaluated by specular microscopy, and central corneal thickness (CCT) was examined by optical coherence tomography after 1, 3, 7, and 14 days of storage. Corneal transparency was scored using slit lamp examination at days 1 and 14.Results:Average ECD, HEX, and CV for the Kerasave (2653 ± 303 cells/mm2, 57 ± 4%, and 36 ± 3%) and Optisol-GS (2623 ± 306 cells/mm2, 57 ± 5%, and 36 ± 4%) groups were not significantly different at day 1. There was also no difference at any other study time points (all P &gt; 0.05). ECD did not significantly change from day 1 to day 14 in either group (P &gt; 0.05), but a statistically significant change in HEX and CV was observed between day 1 and day 14 in both groups (P &lt; 0.01). Average CCT measured at day 1 for corneas stored in Kerasave was 622 ± 49 m and those stored in Optisol-GS was 580 ± 35 m (P &lt; 0.01). The difference in CCT measurements was not significantly different at day 14 (Kerasave: 674 ± 46 m vs. Optisol-GS: 647 ± 58 m, P &gt; 0.05). Corneal transparency was not significantly different between the 2 groups at day 1 or day 14.Conclusions:The corneal quality and clinically relevant parameters including ECD, endothelial morphometry, and corneal transparency were not different in corneas stored in Kerasave or Optisol-GS for 14 days. The initial difference in CCT between the 2 groups decreased at day 14. These results demonstrated that Kerasave corneal storage solution preserves the corneal endothelium similarly to Optisol-GS. © 2023 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

Plasmas 29 083507), we have developed a non-linear moment model for electrons that self-consistently captures non-Maxwellian electron energy distribution function effects. The model does not rely in the local approximation and the transport coefficients are calculated by expanding the distribution function into Hermite polynomials and by taking moments of the Boltzmann equation, including the collision operator for elastic and inelastic collisions with arbitrary cross sections. This model captures the classical Fick’s, Fourier’s, and Ohm’s law as well as Soret, Dufour, and Peltier effects. In addition, novel non-local transport phenomena appear as a result of spatial gradients of the kurtosis of the distribution function. In this paper, we discuss on the transport effects by analyzing two collisional models: constant collision frequency and constant cross section. We estimate the order of magnitude of the transport processes in non-equilibrium electrons by analyzing the Langmuir probe measurements of a low-pressure argon inductively-coupled discharge. The results show that, under these conditions, the transport produced by the spatial gradients in the kurtosis of the distribution function produces a heat-flux contribution that is of the same order of magnitude as the Fourier and Dufour’s effects. These transport effects are beyond the local field or the electron gradient expansions, commonly used in the low-temperature plasma modeling. © 2023 IOP Publishing Ltd.","electron energy distribution functions; equations of fluid dynamics; gas discharges; partially ionized plasma","Boltzmann equation; Dissociation; Electromagnetic induction; Electron energy analyzers; Electron energy levels; Electron temperature; Heat flux; Inductively coupled plasma; Langmuir probes; Poisson equation; Transport properties; Distribution-functions; Electron energy distribution functions; Equation of fluid dynamic; Fluid-dynamics; Fourier; Gas discharge; Partially ionized plasma; Spatial gradients; Transport effects; Transport process; Distribution functions"

Control. Fusion 63 115006), is analyzed in order to investigate the origin of the I p spike and its relation with magnetic stochasticity. The I p spike is associated to a current density (j φ) profile relaxation which appears to result from Shear Alfvén Wave (SAW) propagation along stochastic field lines, as proposed by Boozer (2019 Plasma Phys. Control. Fusion 61 024002; 2020 Phys. Plasmas 27 102305), possibly complemented by a macroscopic E×B flow structure. Using axisymmetric JOREK simulations involving a mean field Ohm’s law, we verify that the level of hyper-resistivity associated to SAWs is consistent with the prediction made in (Boozer 2019 Plasma Phys. Control. Fusion 61 024002; Boozer 2020 Phys. Plasmas 27 102305), which connects the I p spike with the level of stochasticity. The relaxation comprises two main phases, the first one corresponding to a fast (0.1 ms) and almost complete j φ flattening in the q &lt; 2 region, while the second one is longer (0.5 ms) and corresponds to a more gradual, global and incomplete j φ flattening. During the first phase, strong E×B flows develop that play a key role in mixing impurities into the core. © EURATOM 2023.","3D non-linear MHD simulations; disruption; MHD relaxation","Magnetoplasma; Shear flow; Stochastic systems; Tokamak devices; 3d non-linear MHD simulation; Alfven wave propagation; Current spikes; Disruption; MHD relaxation; MHD simulation; Non linear; Plasma currents; Shear Alfven waves; Stochasticity; Magnetohydrodynamics"

Only serotonin reuptake inhibitors and cognitive-behavioral therapy have been demonstrated efficacious in randomized controlled trials. Psilocybin is a psychedelic drug with growing evidence for safety and efficacy in treatment of depression. This study aimed to pilot test the feasibility, tolerability, safety, and efficacy of psilocybin treatment of adults with BDD. Methods: In this open-label trial, 12 adults (8 women, 4 men) with moderate-to-severe non-delusional BDD that had been unresponsive to at least one serotonin reuptake inhibitor trial received a single oral dose of psilocybin 25 mg. There was no control group. Psychological support was provided before, during, and after the dosing session. The primary outcome measure for efficacy was the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Disorder Scale Modified for BDD (BDD-YBOCS) score during 12 weeks of assessments after dosing. Results: All participants completed dosing and all follow-up assessments. BDD-YBOCS scores decreased significantly over 12 weeks of follow-up (p < .001) with a large effect size (partial eta squared = 0.54), and significant changes from baseline were present at week 1 and persisted through week 12. Secondary efficacy measures of BDD symptoms, conviction of belief, negative affect, and disability also improved significantly, and no serious adverse events occurred. At week 12, seven participants (58%) were rated responders, based on ≥30% decrease in BDD-YBOCS. Conclusion: This study provides promising preliminary support for psilocybin as a treatment of BDD, warranting future controlled studies. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Body dysmorphic disorder; Clinical trial; Hallucinogen; Psilocybin","psilocybine; serotonin uptake inhibitor; adult; Article; body dysmorphic disorder; clinical article; clinical feature; coronavirus disease 2019; disability; dizziness; drug efficacy; drug safety; drug tolerability; fatigue; female; follow up; headache; human; insomnia; male; mood disorder; nausea; pilot study; pneumonia; psychological care; remission; somnolence; visual hallucination; Yale Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale"

We investigated this unusual phenomenon by considering the rare occurrence of polyandrous mating and the extremely male-biased operational sex ratio (OSR) at the beginning of the mating season. Theoretically, male-biased OSR can intensify competition for mates, leading to increased polyandry. We estimated OSR (male/female) as 32.7 and 9.1 at the beginning and end of the mating period, respectively. Next, we estimated the rate of polyandry in a population on a weekly basis, based on our new finding that the rate of polyandry can be estimated stochastically from the total number of spermatangia attached to one of the two seminal receptacles within a female. We found that the female squid sustains their highly monoandrous mating regime despite the fact that the OSR is extremely male-biased. Furthermore, there were no significant changes in the polyandry rate during the reproductive season. These results suggest that the squid mating system was not influenced by seasonal changes in OSR.

However, which behavior intervention is more appropriate and when remain elusive. Here, we unexpectedly found that stressed mice experiencing social isolation exhibited less anxiety than those experiencing social contact. Within the first 24 h after returning to their previous social environment, mice experienced acute restraint stress (ARS) displayed low social interest but simultaneously received excessive social disturbance from their cage mates, indicating a critical time window for social isolation to balance the conflict. To screen brain regions that were differentially activated between the poststress social isolation and poststress social contact groups, we performed ΔFosB immunostaining and found that ΔFosB + signals were remarkably increased in the vDG of poststress social isolation group compared with poststress social contact group. There were no significant differences between the two groups in the other anxiety- and social-related brain regions, such as prelimbic cortex, infralimbic cortex, nucleus accumbens, etc. These data indicate that vDG is closely related to the differential phenotypes between the poststress social isolation and poststress social contact groups. Electrophysiological recording, further, revealed a higher activity of vDG in the poststress social isolation group than the poststress social contact group. Chemogenetically inhibiting vDG excitatory neurons within the first 24 h after ARS completely abolished the anxiolytic effects of poststress social isolation, while stimulating vDG excitatory neurons remarkably reduced anxiety-like behaviors in the poststress social contact group. Together, these data suggest that the activity of vDG excitatory neurons is essential and sufficient to govern the anxiolytic effect of poststress social isolation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report to uncover a beneficial role of temporal social isolation in acute stress-induced anxiety. In addition to the critical 24-h time window, activation of vDG is crucial for ameliorating anxiety through poststress social isolation. © The Authors","Acute stress; Anxiolytic effect; Social contact; Social isolation; Ventral dentate gyrus","anxiolytic agent; clozapine; acute stress; amygdala; analysis of variance; animal experiment; animal model; anxiety; Article; central nucleus (amygdala); data analysis; dentate gyrus; electrophysiological procedures; electrophysiology; elevated plus maze test; hippocampus; immunohistochemistry; lateral hypothalamus; locomotion; mouse; nonhuman; open field test; patch clamp technique; phenotype; plasmid; radial arm maze test; social behavior; social interaction; social isolation; ventral dentate gyrus"

By increasing heater power densities and applying modified worst cold boundary conditions for thermal analysis, the thermal design performance for the propellant pipelines of an actual satellite could be improved and verified through thermal vacuum test.

The human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were adopted to investigate the effect of biglycan (BGN) on inflammatory response, and the subsequent outcomes of inflammation on human corneal endothelial cells (HCECs). A total of 174 DEPs were identified in CED AH of patients underwent PKP, including 102 up-regulated proteins and 72 down-regulated proteins. Bioinformatics analysis revealed the significant enrichment of cytokine-mediated signaling pathway and extracellular matrix (ECM) organization in the up-regulated proteins, as well as the alterations of cellular components, including the increase of collagen and complement component C1 complex, and reduction in extracellular exosomes. A hub protein cluster of 15 proteins was determined by Molecular Complex Detection (MCODE), including FN1, BGN, COMP, COL11A1, COLA3A1, and COL1A1. Moreover, BGN promoted pro-inflammatory cytokine (such as TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6) production in PBMCs through NF-κB signaling pathway, which subsequently resulted in HCECs death. These findings provided a systemic protein profile of AH in CED patients after corneal transplantation, with the alterations implicated in cytokine-mediated signaling, ECM, complement system, and exsomes. The identified proteins and signaling pathways probably paved the novel insight into understanding the pathogenesis of the disease. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Aqueous humor; Corneal endothelial decompensation; Corneal transplantation; Pathogenesis; Proteomics","biglycan; collagen; collagen type 1; collagen type 3; collagen type I alpha 1 chain; complement component C1; dexamethasone plus tobramycin; ELAV like protein 2; fibronectin; hydrocortisone; interleukin 1beta; interleukin 6; prednisolone; tacrolimus; tumor necrosis factor; adult; aged; aqueous humor; Article; cell death; clinical article; complement system; controlled study; cornea endothelium; cornea transplantation; cytokine signaling; differential gene expression; down regulation; drug dose reduction; exosome; extracellular matrix; female; human; human cell; human tissue; KEGG; male; NF kB signaling; penetrating keratoplasty; peripheral blood mononuclear cell; protein protein interaction; proteomics; upregulation"

This disorder can lead to various phys-ical and behavioral problems and ultimately reduce the quality of life. Sleep disorders are also among the complaints of patients with FC. Objectives: In this study, we aimed to investigate the prevalence of sleep disorders in children with chronic FC. Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted on 140 children aged 5 to 12 with chronic FC referred to the specialized pediatrics clinic of Amirkabir Hospital of Arak, Iran. The functional constipation was diagnosed based on Rome IV criteria. Children and their parents were requested to complete the Children’s Sleep Habits Questionnaire (CSHQ). Data analysis was performed in SPSS version 22 using the chi-square and Mann-Whitney tests to find significant associations at the significance level of 5%. Results: The mean (SD) age of the participants was 7.36 ± 1.6, and most participants were boys (65.7%). The prevalence of sleep disorders in children with chronic FC was 62.9% (95% CI: 54.5-70.2). Sleep resistance and sleep apnea were the most common minor sleep disorders. The prevalence of sleep disorders was significantly higher in girls (81.3%) than in boys (53.3%) with chronic FC (P = 0.001). There was no significant difference in the prevalence of sleep disorders in children with chronic FC aged 5 to 8 and 9 to 12. Conclusions: In the present study, the results showed that the prevalence of sleep disorders in children with chronic FC was signifi-cant, and it was higher compared to other studies conducted on healthy children, and also it was found that girls had a significantly higher rate of sleep disorders than boys. © 2023, Author(s).","Children; Chronic Functional Constipation; Sleep Disorders","anxiety; Article; child; chronic constipation; cross-sectional study; daytime somnolence; female; groups by age; human; Iran; major clinical study; male; nocturnal awakening; nonREM sleep; parasomnia; preschool child; prevalence; school child; sex difference; sleep disorder; sleep disordered breathing; sleep quality; sleep time"

This regime is mainly thought to pertain to short-pulse laser-generated ion beams, because of the ion energy fluences required to enter this regime. The regime for was thought to be determined by a dimensionless number, Ξ h . Here it is shown that there is another dimensionless number that needs to be considered.

Further, noDQ ROM errors have an optimal behavior, while DQ ROM errors, where the DQ is added to the POD process, demonstrate an optimality/super-optimality behavior.

The object of this prospective cohort research was to identify fibrinolytic characteristics in patients with pancreatic trauma and to identify the correlation to mortality. Method: A prospective screening of traumatic pancreatic injury patients was done for five years. The fibrinolytic status of patients was determined by thromboelastography (TEG). The percentage reduction in clot strength 30 min (LY30) after the time of maximal clot strength was utilized to distinguish the fibrinolytic phenotype of individuals, including fibrinolytic shutdown (SD), physiologic fibrinolysis (PHYS) and hyperfibrinolysis (HF). Two cohorts, transient fibrinolytic shutdown (TSD) and persistent fibrinolytic shutdown (PSD), were divided according to whether fibrinolytic shutdown persisted within one week. Demographics, injury severity, characteristics of pancreatic injury, treatment, and outcomes were compared. Result: A total of 180 cases enrolled, aged 42(interquartile range 32–51) years, 88% males, 97% were blunt trauma. The median ISS was 19(IQR 10–25), and 76% were AAST grade III to V (high-grade). At admission, there were 159 cases of SD (88%), 15 cases of PHYS (8%) while 6 cases of HF (3%). Of these, the TSD cohort included 54 patients (34%), while the PSD cohort included 105 patients (66%). Compared with the TSD cohort, the PSD cohort had more severe injury (ISS 21[IQR 12–27] vs 16[IQR 9–22], p = 0.006) and a higher proportion of AAST high-grade (83% vs 67%, p = 0.035). Persistent fibrinolytic shutdown was associated with operative treatment (odds ratio [OR] 3.111; 95%CI 1.146–8.447; p = 0.026), associated intra-abdominal injury (OR 8.331; 95% CI 1.301–53.336; p = 0.025) and admission LY30 (OR 0.016; 95% CI 0.002 - 0.120; p < 0.001). It was an independent predictor of mortality (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 4.674; 95% CI 1.03 to 21.14; p = 0.045). Conclusion: Fibrinolytic shutdown especially persistence of this phenotype is more common in traumatic pancreatic injury than PHYS and HF, which related with mortality. Risk factors including LY30 at admission, intra-abdominal injury and operative treatment were associated with the persistent fibrinolytic shutdown. Sheltered the patients from these risk factors seems to be beneficial, which need to be confirmed by further large-scale studies. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Fibrinolysis shutdown; Mortality; Non-operative treatment; Traumatic pancreatic injury",

Adult male C. maculatus pass large ejaculates to mates while not feeding. Here, we studied ejaculate production and longevity in C. maculatus males at different temperatures and mating patterns. After development at 25, 27 and 29 °C, eclosing males were weighed and prevented from mating (m0) or allowed to mate once with virgin females three (m3) or five (m5) days after eclosion or to mate twice, three and five days after eclosion (m3+5). We weighed males before and after mating to estimate body mass loss due to ejaculate transfer and depletion of resources over time attributed to routine physiology/evaporation. Warmer conditions increased mortality and development rates and tended to decrease body mass. Males with a large body mass at eclosion survived longer than smaller males. The body mass of males was depleted at daily rates equal to 3–5% of body mass at eclosion. The rates of this loss increased in warmer conditions, suggesting that this process was the main determinant of the thermal pattern of mortality. During a single mating, males produced ejaculates that constituted 2–6% of their body mass at eclosion. Contrary to predictions, ejaculate production did not change with thermal conditions. Body mass losses through ejaculate transfer resulted in increased male mortality, and this effect was two times stronger than the effect of a comparable body mass loss through routine physiology/evaporation. Ejaculate mass decreased with age independent of mating history, suggesting that ejaculate production is restricted by routine physiology/evaporation losses. We conclude that the longevity of male C. maculatus is a function of body mass loss, but the two sources of body mass loss considered here, ejaculates and routine physiology, are not equally costly. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Aphagia; Callosobruchus maculatus; Nuptial gift; Survival; Temperature",

The ecological corridor is an important means to maintain the stability of the watershed ecosystem and enhance the ecological sustainability of the watershed. It has significant demonstration implications for the preservation of biodiversity and the restoration of ecological functions of wetlands with significant ecological value. In this study, the rare white-headed crane distributed in Chongming Dongtan was taken as the research object, and the land use change in Chongming Dongtan in recent ten years was obtained by ENVI and ArcGIS10.8 software. The ecological sources of the white-headed crane population were screened using morphological spatial pattern analysis (MSPA) and landscape connectivity. Using GIS technology to construct a comprehensive resistance surface, combined with circuit theory, the ecological processes in heterogeneous landscapes are simulated by calculating ' resistance ' or ' current ' to identify important ecological corridors, ecological pinch points, and ecological obstacles. The results showed that the region included 24 ecological sources, 46 ecological corridors, 127 ecological pinch points, and 134 Ecological obstacle points. The habitat in the study area showed a trend of fragmentation. The high-resistance areas of Chongming Dongtan were mainly distributed in low-altitude areas with rapid urbanization and frequent human activities, such as Qiyao Town and Yuxi Village. The ecological corridors of White-headed cranes are mainly distributed in bare flat, reed beaches, grassland, and paddy fields. The optimal threshold of MSPA landscape in the study area is 500 m. At the same time, the ecological function area is optimized and divided into different levels, such as ecological core area, ecological buffer zone, ecological crisscross area, production and living area.

Social mate choice is studied less often than reproductive mate choice, but for species that exhibit biparental care, choice of a social mate may have important implications for offspring survival and success. Many species make pairing decisions based on size that can lead to population-scale pairing patterns such as assortative and disassortative mating by size. Other size-based pairing patterns, such as females pairing with males larger than themselves, have been commonly studied in humans, but less often studied in nonhuman animal systems. Here we show that sexually size-dimorphic mountain chickadees, Poecile gambeli, appear to exhibit multiple self-referential pairing patterns when choosing a social mate. Females paired with males that were larger than themselves more often than expected by chance, and they paired with males that were slightly larger than themselves more often than they paired with males that were much larger than themselves. Preference for slightly larger males versus much larger males did not appear to be driven by reproductive benefits as there were no statistically significant differences in reproductive performance between pairs in which males were slightly larger and pairs in which males were much larger than females. Our results indicate that self-referential pairing beyond positive and negative assortment may be common in nonhuman animal systems. © 2023 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour","chickadee; self-referential pairing; sexual size dimorphism; sexual size preference; social mate choice","evolutionary biology; female behavior; male; mate choice; pair bond; parental care; sexual dimorphism; social behavior; songbird; survival"

Moreover, motivated by the results of Lane-Emden solutions for spherically symmetric flows in Luo (Adv Math 291:90–182, 2016), the nonlinear asymptotic stability of the axisymmetric solution is proved with detailed convergence rates. We show that the velocity components uϕ and uz have better decay rates (1 + t) - 1 than ur due to the special structures of the equations. The solutions capture the precise physical behavior that the sound speed is C1 / 2-Hölder continuous across the vacuum boundary provided that the adiabatic exponent γ∈ (5 / 4 , 2). The main difficulties of this problem lie in the singularity at the symmetry axis, the degeneracy of the system near the free boundary and the strong coupling between the three components of velocity, especially for the lower-order estimate of angular velocity vϕ in Lagrangian coordinates. We overcome these obstacles by making a new bounded assumption on |x-1/2vxϕ|+|x-3/2vϕ|, introducing a new functional E2(t):=μ2‖x12((vxϕ-vϕ/x),vxz)(·,t)‖L2 (see (2.8)), which helps to obtain some estimates of time derivatives of vϕ and vz (see (4.9)), and using a truncation function method. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",,

These momentum densities are also related to forces and torques. We show in this way that torques like D × E and B × H appear in these balance equations transformed into balance equations of angular momentum. The density D × E was used by Beth [Phys. Rev. 50 115–125 (1936)] to measure the angular momentum of radiation fields in interaction with anisotropic dielectrics. Our analysis show that also static or quasi-static fields carry angular momentum and produce torques when interacting with anisotropic materials. © 2023 The Authors","Anisotropic materials; Balance of angular momentum; Electromagnetic angular momentum of static fields; Electromagnetic torque density; Macroscopic maxwell equations",

Aims: This study set out to examine whether cognitive and maths performance of children with high ADHD symptoms differs depending on the co-occurrence of movement difficulties given evidence that weaker visuospatial processing, known to be important for maths performance, differentiates ADHD and DCD. We also aimed to examine whether relationships between cognition and maths in ADHD differs depending on co-occurring movement difficulties. Methods: Participants were 43 drug naïve children between 6 and 12 years old (M = 101.53 months SD = 19.58). The ADHD-only group (n = 18) included children with high ADHD scores, and those in the ADHD+DCD group (n = 25) concurrently had high movement difficulty scores. All completed executive function and memory, including 2 visuo-spatial memory tasks from the CANTAB battery and Mathematics Problem Solving, Numeracy, and Maths Fluency tasks from the WIAT-III and specific factual, conceptual, and procedural maths component tasks. Results: Children in the ADHD+DCD group scored significantly lower on visuospatial working memory (WM) capacity, than those in the ADHD-only group. Both groups were comparable on all other cognitive assessments of executive functions, memory, and processing speed. The groups did not differ in their maths attainment scores, nor on more specific maths skills. Comparison of the correlations between cognitive processes and maths revealed that the association between visuospatial WM updating and procedural skill efficiency was stronger for the ADHD-only group. Moreover, associations between visuospatial WM and maths problem solving attainment were stronger in the ADHD+DCD group. Conclusions: Despite similarities in maths performance, children with ADHD+DCD could be distinguished by lower visuospatial WM. Differential associations with some of the maths domain implicate recruitment of different cognitive processes for some aspects of maths. This distinction can be particularly useful for conceptualising cognitive characteristics of different clinical groups and understanding cognitive pathways of maths difficulties.

Water and 50% aqueous ethanol solution were used as solvent and the effect of solvent-to-solid ratio, particle size, stirring speed (AE) and ultrasound power amplitude (UAE) was examined. Two kinetic models (i.e. Peleg model and swelling / diffusion model) have been introduced to describe the kinetics of TPC extraction. The experimental data were adequately fitted by swelling/diffusion model (R2&gt;0.98; EP&lt;10%; RMSE&lt;0.24) that considers two mechanisms coupled at different rates. The initial extraction rate increased at a higher volume of solvent (10 ml/g), smaller particle size (0.297 mm) higher ultrasound power amplitude (100%) and the use of 50% aqueous ethanol solution. Maximum equilibrium TPC concentration was observed with the synergic effect of 50% aqueous ethanol solution and the higher power amplitude (15,0 g GAE/100 g dm). This work would provide more information on the extraction mechanisms that occur in the microstructure of yerba mate leaves for the industrial production of TPC. © 2023 Institution of Chemical Engineers","Agitation extraction; Ilex paraguariensis St. Hil; Kinetic modelling; Phenolic compounds; Ultrasound-assisted extraction","Ethanol; Kinetic theory; Kinetics; Organic solvents; Particle size; Phenols; Pyrene; Ultrasonics; Agitation extraction; Aqueous ethanol solutions; Diffusion model; Ilex paraguariensis St. Hil; Kinetic models; Phenolic compounds; Total phenolic compounds; Ultrasound power; Ultrasound-assisted extraction; Yerba mate leaves; Extraction"

Aims: In the present study, we tested whether WISC-IV cognitive profiles can be useful to single out DD. Methods and procedures: Using a stringent 2-SD cutoff in a standardized numeracy battery, we identified children with DD (N = 43) within a clinical sample referred for assessment of learning disability and compared them in terms of WISC cognitive indexes to the remaining children without DD (N = 100) employing cross-validated logistic regression. Outcomes and results: Both groups showed higher Verbal Comprehension and Perceptual Reasoning than Working Memory and Processing Speed, and DD scores were generally lower. Predictive accuracy of WISC indexes in identifying DD individuals was low (AUC = 0.67) and it dropped to chance level in discriminating DD from selected controls (N = 43) with average math performance but matched on global IQ. The inclusion of a visuospatial memory score as an additional predictor did not improve classification accuracy. Conclusions and implications: These results demonstrate that cognitive profiles do not reliably discriminate DD from non-DD children, thereby weakening the appeal of domain-general accounts. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Developmental dyscalculia; Diagnosis; Math disability; Specific learning disabilities","child; comprehension; dyscalculia; human; learning disorder; psychology; short term memory; Wechsler intelligence scale; Child; Comprehension; Dyscalculia; Humans; Learning Disabilities; Memory, Short-Term; Wechsler Scales"

For the analogous problem on the real line (for which the least approximable number is the golden ratio, by Hurwitz’s theorem), the approximabilities comprise the classically studied Lagrange and Markoff spectra, but work by Cha–Kim [Intrinsic Diophantine approximation on the unit circle and its Lagrange spectrum, arXiv: 1903.02882, 2021] and Cha–Chapman–Gelb–Weiss [Monatsh. Math. 197 (2022), pp. 1–55] shows that the spectra of conics can vary. We provide notions of approximability, Lagrange spectrum, and Markoff spectrum valid for a general C and prove that their behavior is exhausted by the special family of conics Cn : XZ = nY 2, which has symmetry by the modular group Γ0(n) and whose Markoff spectrum was studied in a different guise by A. Schmidt and Vulakh [Trans. Amer. Math. Soc. 352 (2000), pp. 4067–4094]. The proof proceeds by using the Gross-Lucianovic bijection to relate a conic to a quaternionic subring of Mat2×2(Z) and classifying invariant lattices in its 2-dimensional representation. © 2023 by Evan M.
